</div>

<p>Great numbers of people, especially medical
men, have written to me asking me to
continue the short studies of great men of the
past that I began in <i>Post Mortem</i>; and the result
is the present volume.</p>

<p>Many reviewers complained that <i>Post Mortem</i>
contained too much “medical jargon,” whatever
that may mean. There is doubtfully
such a thing as medical jargon; it is merely a
method of expressing thoughts for which there is
no English equivalent except by the method of
a cumbrous sentence. For that reason I have
tried to translate my thoughts into English whenever
it is possible. If by mischance a technical
term should have crept in, you will find most
medical terms in any decent modern English
dictionary; or failing that, they are all simply
taken from the Greek. But there is another
jargon than medical. There is the filthy jargon
which insists on saying “the Red Plague” when
we mean syphilis; or “in a certain interesting
condition” when we mean to say “pregnant.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span></p>

<p>That jargon I absolutely refuse to use. Those
elderly people with fixed minds who prefer that
sort of thing had better stick to <i>Little Arthur</i> or
something equally fictitious. As a doctor writing
on very serious subjects I must claim the doctor’s
privilege of writing with absolute frankness;
without suspicion of coarseness.</p>

<p>And I beg you not to accept as diagnoses what
are sheer speculations.</p>

<p>The first drafts of these essays appeared in
the <i>Australasian Medical Journal</i>, <i>The
Sydney Bulletin</i>, the Australian <i>Home, Art in
Australia</i>, and the Australian <i>Forum</i>. They
have nearly all been considerably modified with
the growth of knowledge and frequent rewriting.
I have to thank Miss Kibble, of the New South
Wales Public Library, for assisting me immensely
in hunting up many authorities from whom I
quote. Without her help this book could never
have been written.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Dr_Johnson">Dr. Johnson</h2>

</div>

<p>There can be little doubt that the illustrious
Dr. Johnson was a psychasthenic.
His father could see in life nothing but gloom,
though his mother seems to have been hearty and
sensible enough. Therefore presumably we are
entitled to say that the Great Cham’s family history
was faulty. At an early age he developed
some trouble that his parents diagnosed as scrofula,
or tuberculous glands of the neck, but Boswell
expressly hints was suspected to have been
caught from a nurse. They took him to England’s
kindly but not intelligent majesty, Queen
Anne, who, wearing a long black hood and diamonds
to impress her patients, touched him for
his “grievous malady.” But she did not cure
him; rather it would seem that she made him
worse; for all Johnson’s frightful jerkings and
grimaces, roarings and puffings, may possibly be
traced back to that one moment of nervous tension
when he felt himself a little boy, the observed
of all observers, waiting to be touched by
the sister-in-law of William the Dutchman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>A child of bad heredity—indeed any child—must
be treated with the utmost care long before
it appears to be conscious, before it appears to
take notice of what is going on around it; quarrelsome
parents and angry nurses may so warp his
whole mental outlook that it is spoiled for life.
And it could not have been a good thing for the
coming Great Cham to subject him to such
nervous strain as was necessarily involved in taking
him before Queen Anne. He was lucky in
that it did not make him stammer. Many a
sensitive boy has been made to stammer by less
than was involved in Sam’s childish treatment.
Long before a child appears to be conscious its
mind is taking notice of all that goes on around
it, and its whole future life may be warped in
one moment of terror or anxiety. And the sad
thing is that probably Mrs. Johnson senior had
made a mistake in diagnosis, that probably little
Sam was not suffering from scrofula at all, but
from some swelling of the glands of the neck that
was due to something in his scalp. That he lived
till he was seventy-five seems to show that he
never suffered either from tuberculosis or syphilis,
those two great slayers; and if his glands had
really been tuberculous it is probable that, bursting,
they would have formed a “mixed infection”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
that would have had more serious effects than
mere local scarring.</p>

<p>It is possible that while the incident persisted
in Johnson’s conscious memory as a “confused and
solemn memory,” in his unconscious memory it
may have persisted in those extraordinary antics
which to Boswell seemed a sort of St. Vitus’s
dance. Perhaps in them we see the struggles of
a sensitive little boy to avoid the frightful ordeal
of being “touched” and resentment at the insult
to his masculine grandeur. We know that his
masculinity had already been very much insulted
at the age of three when a schoolmistress ran after
him lest he fall into the gutter.</p>

<p>Psychasthenia is a grim half-sister to neurasthenia,
from which it appears to differ in that,
while neurasthenia merely shows that the man’s
nervous system is not sufficiently strong to stand
the stout clouts and buffets of this wicked world,
in psychasthenia he has never had a chance. The
best translation of the term “psychasthenic” appears
to be “unbalanced,” and, though probably
psychasthenia was about the best term that Professor
Janet could have selected for this queer
condition, still it conveys an unwarranted implication
of imbecility, for many men of the greatest
genius have been utterly unbalanced. The man of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
genius is seldom actually insane, but he is often
unbalanced and of the manic-depressive temperament;
at any moment he may be “knocked off his
perch” and may become definitely insane.</p>

<p>Thus, subject always to the possible denial of
the alienists, I should certainly imagine that
Beethoven was psychasthenic, for he was always
falling in and out of love, was constantly quarrelling
with his landlords, cast his rice pudding
at the cook, jammed his hat fiercely on his head
when he and Goethe walked before royalty, was
looked upon as crazy, and used to run about the
fields trying to roar the latest melody that had
come into his head. And Charles Lamb not only
stammered but had a sister who was definitely insane.</p>

<p>The unbalanced are subject to queer actions
which appear to take their origin in the unconscious
mind. Thus, there arise from the unconscious
into consciousness imperative ideas which
insist on recognition however malapropos they
may happen to be. Sometimes these actually go
on to form obsessions, and I must ask you to
permit me to define these two important terms.
The imperative idea simply arises into consciousness
out of the unconscious. When it compels
appropriate action it is generally, though not always,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
called an obsession. Thus, when Johnson
walked along Fleet Street the imperative idea
arose from his unconscious that it would be a fitting
thing to put his hand upon every horse-post
that he passed. When he did so or turned on his
tracks that no horse-post should be left uncapped
the definition of an obsession would appear to be
correct. And from the unconscious arise those
queer phobias or fears which often so strangely
influence their actions.</p>

<p>Still gossiping about the unbalanced, was St.
Francis of Assisi entirely sane when he left all
the money that he owed his father on a heap of
his clothes and set out to build a church with his
own hands? If this be insanity let us have more
of it. The ordinary sane stodgy man does not
lead the world; secure in his stodginess he makes
money and lives happy ever after. But the genius
is always a little “cracked,” otherwise he would
probably not be a genius. And so many of them
have been ill men; in fact one can hardly call to
mind as one writes a single really healthy and
sane genius, unless possibly Sir Walter Scott. St.
Francis is said to have had renal tuberculosis.</p>

<p>That is probably the only real serious objection
to birth-control; you can never tell whom you are
condemning to perpetual absence of life. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Abraham Lincoln, strictly speaking, should never
have been born, for his mother, Nancy Hanks,
though never insane, lived all her life in the
depths of gloom and on the verge of insanity.
Yet it would appear that the absence of Old Abe
at a given crisis of the world’s history might have
made some difference to civilisation. And even if
we are to take bodily health as the criterion of
fitness, what about Mozart, the tuberculous and
pallid little genius of Vienna whom many people
still consider as the very greatest musician that
ever lived? Certainly not even Beethoven in his
first period ever attained to Mozart’s delicious
childlikeness of touch.</p>

<p>If the world had insisted that St. Francis of
Assisi, Abe Lincoln, and Wolfgang Amadeus
Mozart should not have been born one would
think that the world would now be a poorer place
than it is. And one names only a few; for
Spinoza should never have been born, doomed to
live only a few years and then to die of tuberculosis
while he was mystically trying to reduce
God to a mathematical formula.</p>

<p>In fact one could go on for weeks on this subject,
and the conclusion that any fair-minded person
must reach is that birth-control, even of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
apparently unfit, is too risky an experiment for
the human race to try if it wishes to keep its
geniuses. You never can tell what the infant
may turn out that you are preventing from being
born. But I am aware that this is a highly contentious
subject, and that awful thing, “the sex-war,”
is involved in it. People are sure to have
differences of opinion about it; since woman has
risen to her new estate these opinions will assuredly
be held with more vigour than ever.</p>

<p>“Treat ’em rough” is a known and tried aphorism,
which has been elevated to a pitch of almost
epic grandeur by Schopenhauer’s “Pitch ’em
downstairs”; and probably some such aphorism
was in Johnson’s mind when he rode with old
Mrs. Porter to the church that they might be married,
and, you remember, reduced her to tears before
they got there. Up till then he probably had
only the poet’s knowledge of woman; but that
after such an ill beginning the marriage turned out
so happily, seems to argue that Mrs. Porter,
though she might paint her face, was nevertheless
a woman with the heart of a lion to tame his aggressively
masculine soul. And it is quite possible
that before she died—she was twice his age, you
know—he began to have for her a love similar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
to that one has for a mother. Of course it may be
that Boswell, in his uncomplimentary description
of Johnson’s wife, was misled by jealousy of her
who sat too near the throne of his hero-worship.
But in any case she must have been a remarkable
woman to tame Ursa Major as she did.</p>

<p>If one were to translate psychasthenic into
“poor in spirit”—which is not very far from its
Greek meaning—probably we should come very
near to its real inner meaning; and we have the
best possible authority for knowing the post-mortem
future of the poor in spirit. If the Kingdom
of Heaven is to be composed of such men as Johnson
and Beethoven it would not be a bad place to
inhabit, though the shade of Johnson would certainly
insist on carrying home some fallen angel,
while Beethoven would probably throw something
at a monotonous orchestra of harps, if he could
hear it.</p>

<p>In support of the contention that towards the
end of her life he had begun to consider Mrs.
Porter as less a wife in the ordinary sense of the
term than a mother-surrogate whom he could
trust as a faithful friend who would never desert
him whatever the circumstances, here is a letter
that he wrote to the Rev. Dr. Taylor on the day
she died:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>

<p>“Pray desire Mrs. Taylor to inform me what
mourning I should buy for my mother and Miss
Porter, and bring a note of writing with you.”</p>

</div>

<p>His dear wife dead he could not trust himself
even to buy mourning without her aid.</p>

<p>He appears not to have been able even to take
care of himself without some woman to act the
mother towards him. Years later he found another
mother-surrogate in Mrs. Thrale, who saw
to it that he wore respectable clothing with brass
buttons, and silver buckles—not too big—on his
shoes. It was evidently a severe blow to him
when the naughty thing went and married Signor
Piozzi, for it left him without a single woman to
show him how to take care of himself.</p>

<p>That nervous malady which Boswell diagnosed
as a sort of St. Vitus’s dance probably merely
represented the violent impulsive and involuntary
movements occasionally seen in psychasthenia;
had the defect affected the nerves of speech Johnson
would probably have stammered; but one can
never imagine a man so aggressive stammering.</p>

<p>How far back in life is it possible to remember?
Freud thinks that the first five years of life
are not retained in conscious memory, although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
they exercise the greatest possible influence upon
our afterlives. Personally I try to think that
my first recollection is that of the frightful itching
that accompanied the wearing of my first pair of
knickerbockers, which my mother used to tell me
occurred on my fourth birthday; but it is so difficult
to distinguish between what you remember
and what older people have told you that one must
sometimes think that after all probably Freud
may be right, and it is impossible to remember
before the fifth birthday.</p>

<p>Johnson’s roars and bluster were probably
really to conceal an innate shyness that is frequently
seen in very nervous men. In further
evidence that he was at heart a shy man here is a
letter that he wrote to his old friend Dr. Birch:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“March 29, 1765.</p>

<p class="noindent">“To Dr. Birch,</p>

<p class="noindent">“Sir:</p>

<p>“I have sent some parts of my dictionary, such
as were at hand, for your inspection. The favour
which I ask of you is that if you do not like them,
you will say nothing.</p>

<p>“I am, sir,</p>

<p>“Your most affectionate humble servant,</p>

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Sam Johnson</span>.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>He could not even bear to hear the faithful
words of his old friend about the child of his brain,
though he felt himself entitled to sign “your most
affectionate humble servant.”</p>

<p>Like most men of apparently strong common
sense, when you look too critically into their dogmata,
Johnson’s common sense begins to look
more like uncommon foolishness; for it was certainly
no answer to Bishop Berkeley’s metaphysics
to bang his foot against a stone. It requires
a far more subtle argument which must
probably be fortified by the eye of faith, which,
you remember, has been defined as “the faculty
of believing what you know to be untrue.” But
Johnson’s argument is the sort of bluff obvious
thing that so appeals to a common-sense person
like John Bull. And doubtless that is why
Johnson has so appealed to John Bull that he
has almost been elevated to the pinnacle of a
national hero. Full of rats, poor old gentleman;
yet one can’t help loving him for his rats.</p>

<p>As woman seldom stammers, so she is seldom
afflicted by psychasthenia, which, being a variation,
appears to be almost confined to the male,
like genius. Woman is seldom “ratty”; she has far
too much hard common sense. Who ever heard
of women killing each other to settle whether a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
word should be spelt homooisian or homoousian?
Or to decide whether there are three Gods or One?
Yet men have waged savage tumult over these
very things, which no person can possibly know.
Sometimes lady novelists seem to go ratty when
they try to describe men, and ultimately describe
some creature who is like nothing on earth; but
it is only fair to say that such lady novelists are
suspected by men to be between the ages of forty
and fifty, and probably for a time slightly unbalanced.
But the normal average woman is far
saner than the normal average man. Once she
has secured her man her chief duty afterwards
seems to be to see that his rats do not lead him
away from the paths of respectability, into such
nonsense as that of Bernard Palissy, for instance,
who burned even his furniture to keep the stove
going that might lead to the discovery of a porcelain
glaze, even though his wife and children
might starve. No woman ever followed a will-o’-the-wisp
with such fury, simply because no
woman was ever so ratty; it is hardly respectable;
it seems to be purely a matter of sex-physiology.</p>

<p>But we must dilate yet a little further on the
utterly unbalanced character of Johnson. An incident
is told of him in 1784, when he was about
74 years of age; as it is impossible to tell it better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
than Boswell, let us leave it in Boswell’s own
words. “Coming home late one night he found
a poor woman lying in the street, so much exhausted
that she could not walk; he took her upon
his back” (by the way it was a quite unnecessarily
laborious and cumbersome way to carry a
woman; for a giant like Sam it would have seemed
an easier matter to stoop down and pick her up
in his arms), “and carried her to his home, where
he found her to be one of those wretched females
who have sunk to the lowest levels of vice, poverty,
and disease. Instead of upbraiding her he
had her taken care of with all care and tenderness
for a long time at considerable expense, till
she was restored to health and endeavoured to put
her into a virtuous way of living.” This was just
the sort of kind, impulsive, and senseless thing
that would seem so utterly natural to a psychasthenic
and so utterly silly to a normal man. We
know now that it is almost impossible to reclaim
a prostitute, for no normal woman ever becomes
a prostitute. Normal woman always has far too
much dignity and self-respect and reads too mystic
a meaning into the sexual act ever to offer
herself to the embraces of any casual man in the
street, however great her economic distress; rather
if driven into a corner by poverty a normal woman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
finds some one male friend to help her, so that she
may console herself with the thought that at least
she is married in the sight of God, if not in the
sight of man. Normal woman is essentially monogamous.
But Sam appears to have been as
hopeful of success as Theodora when she made her
famous raid upon the brothels of Byzantium; one
would like to know the ultimate success or failure
of his adventure into the underworld. We know
that poor Theodora failed absolutely. One cannot
help wondering what Anna Williams would have
thought of it, for women are the enemies of
women; but fortunately for her she seems to have
been recently dead, having quarrelled with everyone
who was open to quarrel with her. If this
be true, at least she never knew to what depths
of degradation Samuel could sink. But a doctor
can easily imagine the fulsome gratitude that
would be lavished by the poor starving prostitute
upon the huge preserver when she woke up and
found him giving her something to eat without
wanting anything else from her. Prostitutes do
not meet with so much disinterested kindness in
this world that it ever palls. That is why it is
so sad that sexual reclamation of them is almost
impossible, for too often they carry the seeds of
their own destruction with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>Then there is that delicious incident of Mr.
Osborn the bookseller. “The fellow insulted me,
so I beat him; but it was in the privacy of my own
chamber—it was not in his shop.” Of course. To
knock down a publisher was only quite right and
proper. Who would not do it? But even a publisher
has his rights. To do it in his own shop
would be to expose him to the insults of his own
servants, and that is positively not done, especially
by an Oxford man. Rats, pure rats. Yet publishers
are said to be fair game for authors and
so far no close-season has been proclaimed for
them.</p>

<p>Few men attain to the age of seventy odd without
some warning that they are mortal and that
the grave is waiting. Of course there is the classic
instance of Voltaire, who from the age of sixty
odd complained of mortal illness, and yet, recovering,
lived to a vast age, wizened, malicious, and
“peaky” as a rat. But then, like Mr. Blake, Voltaire
was a regular out and out hardened sinner
and words could not possibly express the contempt
that he felt for the mediæval devil of eighteenth-century
Christianity. Probably he persisted in
living on just to cheat the devil of his just due
because he despised him so.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact we often find that soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
after fifty some illness attacks a man from which
he never really recovers, even though he may appear
to be well; there is always the trifling difference
in him that marks the passage of the years.
Johnson’s warning came to him—though he did
not observe it—many years before when Boswell
could observe the sight that he made of himself
as he gobbled his meals.</p>

<p>He was evidently very fond of eating; himself,
he boasted of his delicate tastes in food; and when
he ate “the veins of his forehead stood out and
a strong perspiration was visible.” This appears
to have much disgusted Macaulay, but most of
us have seen similar prowess in perfectly worthy
men. Presumably when Boswell said “the veins
of his forehead” he meant the superficial temporal
arteries, for if they had really been the soft and
thin-walled veins, Johnson, bestrewn with bladders,
would have looked indeed noteworthy. But
there came a time when they stood out once too
often, and probably they never shrank back again
to the normal size, but became thickened. Thus
his blood-pressure rose under the strain of arteriosclerosis
and in the course of years the inevitable
results of gluttony overtook him. Drink, guzzle,
and syphilis are the three deadly sins, and they
are deadly in proportion to the effect that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
cause upon the arteries. And in the term
“arteries” one includes heart and kidneys. The
heart is simply a large expansion of an artery, and
the kidneys are merely a network of arterioles and
capillaries; if one part goes all the rest follow,
and thus it is that the term “cardiovascular disease”
is generally used to describe the results of
high blood-pressure. It is of course possible that
Johnson’s glooms may have been due to intestinal
auto-intoxication; but melancholia is a constant
companion of an unduly sensitive nervous system.</p>

<p>Warnings came in 1782 with breathlessness and
pain in the chest; the heart was evidently beginning
to rebel, but the first real alarming warning
came on the night of June 17th, 1783, when he
awoke in the middle of the night and found that
he could not speak. Trying to write, he found
that “my hand made wrong letters,” that is to say
he had not only aphasia, but “agraphia” or loss
of power to write. Possibly if anybody had happened
to think of it he might have been able to
communicate with the outer world by means of
children’s block letters. But nobody did; and
when his servant came in the morning he could
not comprehend why the old gentleman expected
him to read something that he had written instead
of speaking in answer to his own chatter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span></p>

<p>This sudden aphasia in old people is not uncommon,
and may be due to several causes, that
all in one way or other affect the so-called “speech
centre” of the brain. As the “writing centre” is
situated in the very near vicinity, it is not surprising
that a lesion that affects one generally also
affects the other. That Johnson’s right hand was
not also paralysed at the same time is rather unusual,
because the left side of the brain which
controls the right side of the body also contains
the speech centre; and it is supposed that it does
so because man has for many thousands of years
been accustomed to use his right hand more than
his left, wherefore the left side of his brain would
naturally be more ready to acquire new functions
than the right, which only controls the comparatively
awkward left hand. If this theory be true
it would rather seem to show that men were accustomed
to use their right hands long before they
could speak; and this indeed is quite probable.</p>

<p>The exact lesion would appear to have been that
one of the cerebral arteries that supplied the left
side of Johnson’s brain had for some reason been
thrown into a state of spasm, and caused temporary
softening of the brain owing to interference
with its blood-supply. If an artery had actually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
burst on the site of a tiny aneurysm, as occasionally
happens in cases of arteriosclerosis, the old
man would not have recovered so soon, even temporarily.
As it was, he seems to have recovered
sufficiently by July to pay a visit to Dr. Langton
at Rochester. The shock and terror induced by an
attack of aphasia are generally very dreadful. I
remember one elderly lady, who had always been
of a most gentle and virtuous way of living, who
one day suddenly sat up in bed with a scream,
clutching at her bedclothes and at her throat
and uttering meaningless noises like an ape.
Twelve hours later she had for a time recovered
her power of speech, and after lying musing for
half an hour, said in her customary gentle voice,
“I should like some fish; they say fish is good for
the brain.” She had somewhere read that fish contains
a large amount of phosphorus, which is supposed
to be good for the brain—by patent-medicine
vendors. But I shall never forget the scream
of that poor lady, nor the look of terror that came
over her gentle face.</p>

<p>Johnson’s terror led him to write a prayer for
his recovery, done in Latin verse. “The lines
were not very good, but I knew them to be not
very good, so concluded that I was not impaired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
in my faculties.” There you see at once the supreme
passion of the man—Learning—coming
out in what he thought to be the very article of
death.</p>

<p>Then, “in order to rouse the vocal organs, I
took two drams. Wine has been celebrated for
the production of eloquence, so I put myself into
violent motion and I think repeated it; but all
was in vain.” It is hardly fair to comment upon
this action of a man bemused with terror and
aphasia that probably wine was the very worst
thing he could have taken; for it tends to raise
the blood-pressure. Not that it made much difference;
Death was focussing his eyes on Dr. Johnson;
the call was coming, and no earthly power
could avert it.</p>

<p>But apparently even Boswell nods; for after
telling of Johnson’s terrible illness in 1783 he
goes on to tell how in <i>1784</i> he was able to put a
woman on his back and carry her home. Well,
one simply does not believe it; the thing is impossible;
Boswell must have got his dates mixed
a little; for to carry a woman, even though she
were starving and the man a giant, is no small
feat; and if the man were very old and had just
recovered from an attack of aphasia, it would be
absolutely incredible. Really, wonderful though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
we men are—in no way more wonderful than in
our power of believing nonsense—we are not such
terrible fellows as some say.</p>

<p>After the paralytic stroke all the devils in hell
seem to have settled upon the poor old gentleman,
with their gout, dropsy, and continual fear of
death. Probably the gout was simply another
manifestation of the defect of metabolism—faulty
chemical physiological process, or dystrophy—that
had caused his high blood-pressure.
The asthma and oppression in his chest were probably
due to a failing heart; and thence also doubtless
came the dropsy; for dropsy is not a disease—it
is a symptom of many things, generally cardiac
or renal. And his cough became exceedingly
troublesome, possibly due to congestion of the base
of his lungs that would be caused in a way much
the same as caused the dropsy; he was becoming
“water-logged.”</p>

<p>A rather remarkable thing is that, once having
become filled up with dropsy, he got rid of it apparently
suddenly. If I remember rightly Dr.
Johnson was taking squills at the time, and squills
is still used for getting rid of fluid from the body,
though it has been supplanted by more efficient
drugs. One might perhaps think that hope told
Johnson a flattering tale, but he says expressly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
that he got rid of twenty pints. Queer things
happen in dropsy, and even such a pseudo-miracle
as Johnson’s is not unknown. Once water-logged
with dropsy, legs, belly, lungs and all, it would
have seemed to require a miracle to get him emptied,
and miracles seldom happen.</p>

<p>The really wonderful thing is, however, that
a man of so gloomy a temperament as the Great
Cham should have retained such comparative
cheerfulness of spirits as he had even after an experience
so depressing as an attack of aphasia. He
must have been a remarkably brave old man, which
is quite in accordance with his strongly masculine
character. And this discovery of the wrong dating
of one of the most remarkable things that Boswell
tells of him only makes his conduct more
heroic; for if what I surmise is true, Miss Williams
must have been alive and quarrelsome, ready
to give Sam the rough side of her tongue for daring
to carry home a woman of abandoned character.
Cynics have said that to marry a woman is to
marry a conscience; but it is even more terrible
when the woman is not a man’s wife, but, old,
blind, deaf, and quarrelsome, is dependent on his
generosity for a living. She may probably consider
it her duty to look after his morals as strictly
as though she were his wife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>His actual end seems to have been caused by a
mild terminal pneumonia, which in a healthy
young person would have been thrown off like
a cold in the head; but was too much for ancient
lungs and tired heart.</p>

<p>“To be miserable,” said Goldsmith, who had
known what it was to be inarticulate and despised,
“was to ensure the protection of Dr. Johnson.”
Was not that a better definition of sainthood
than whimsically to pervert the Sermon on the
Mount?</p>

<p>To sum up, probably all Johnson’s psychasthenic
involuntary movements, which made him
so strange a figure to his contemporaries, took their
origin in unconscious memory of some affront to
his childish masculinity, such as would be caused
by taking him to Queen Anne to be “touched.”
And she was not even a king, nor yet even in the
direct line of accession either! These women!
They will go poking their noses in everywhere.</p>

<p>And possibly here too many have been the
source of those extraordinary imperative ideas
which it was dangerous to deny, lest he roar at
you for an ignorant and intolerant fellow. Assuredly
you cannot treat a child too carefully if
you want it to grow up a sane and normal member
of the human race.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="King_Henry_the_Saint">King Henry the Saint</h2>

</div>

<p>It was probably because of his unfair treatment
when he was a child that Henry VI of
pathetic memory was driven “psychasthenic” in
its etymological meaning of “weak-souled.” His
father was Henry V, the strong man of Agincourt;
his mother Katherine of Valois, herself the daughter
of a lunatic. This little boy, of unsound
heredity, was born at Windsor while his father
was fighting in France, and barely was he five
months old when his mother bethought her that
her duty was by the side of her husband. She
therefore left her baby to the care of a wet-nurse
while she herself crossed the Channel. At that
time Henry V was sickening for the illness which
was soon to kill him. Probably it was the result
of hard fighting and worry, together with, as was
so often the case with fifteenth-century kings,
eating too much.</p>

<p>When he was less than two years old his faithful
lieges of the House of Commons asked that
they might see him; so mother, nurse and baby
set off in “chairs” from Windsor to London. On
a certain Saturday they reached Staines, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
banks of the Thames, and on the following day
they had purposed to journey to London. But
alas! this defilement of the Sabbath so horrified
the little king, then doubtless “teething,” that he
set up a vast hullabaloo: so bitterly did he weep
that the distracted mother and nurse had perforce
to take him back to his lodgings, where doubtless
the maternal slipper bore its part in his education,
for the horrified chronicler tells us that she
used every effort. This may have been the first
of the famous thrashings that little Henry received,
though probably there had been others;
in fact, his boyhood seems, to put it crudely, to
have been one long wallop. The day of rest having
been passed in consoling the infant, and no
doubt giving him teething powders or dill-water,
and other days having arrived by effluxion of time,
they finally got him up to Westminster, where
doubtless he twiddled his toes and “gooed” before
an admiring concourse of members of Parliament.
Soon afterwards the privy council appointed another
nurse, probably because the first had so signally
failed to smother his bawlings when his subjects
had wished to see him. To her he gave an
edict that she was to use “every effort to reasonably
chastise Us on meet occasion”; so it was clear
that chastisement bulked largely in the thoughts<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
of fifteenth-century educationists in dealing with
Henry VI.</p>

<p>When he was five he opened Parliament in person,
and was set upon a horse to ride throughout
London, where the lieges remarked upon the wonderful
likeness he bore to the “lovely countenance”
of his illustrious father. Quite probably there was
a certain amount of imagination in this remark,
because everybody knows how a lump of putty on
a baby’s face is stoutly asserted by an adoring
nurse to be the living image of the noble Roman
nose of its father. The imagination of nurses
is indeed wonderful.</p>

<p>Then he was, by the terms of his father’s will,
put into the hands of the Earl of Warwick as
preceptor. Warwick is generally held to have
been the model of a preceptor, but one has doubts;
for in after years, when Henry had reached the
years of articulate complaint, he meekly spoke to
the privy council of the thrashings that he had
had to endure. Byron has well summed up the
orthodox method of instruction:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O ye who teach the ingenuous youth of nations,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">England, France, Holland, Italy or Spain;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">I pray you chastise them on all occasions;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It mends their morals—never mind the pain.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>
<p>And as the House of Lancaster was nothing if
not orthodox I have no doubt that the good Earl
did his duty faithfully by his pupil.</p>

<p>Next he had to be crowned King of England;
and the ceremony seems to have been distinguished
by the inordinate number of times that the
archbishop had to strip the little boy to his undershirt
and make him don other robes. A collection
of clerics had to assist him off the platform staggering
under the weight of that crown which was
to prove too heavy for him when the murderous
political uproar of the Wars of the Roses came to
pass.</p>

<p>Then they took him to Paris to crown him King
of France, by order of his father, who, dying, still
considered himself the great conqueror of France.
According to Miss Christie, biographer of Henry
VI, the English did everything possible on the occasion
to hurt the feelings of the French, but
probably little Henry quite enjoyed the service,
just like a modern schoolboy. At any rate he got
away for a time from his preceptor, who had been
busily employed as gaoler to Joan of Arc, treating
her with quite unnecessary savagery.</p>

<p>Then came the long process of making peace
with France after the Hundred Years’ War. It
seems to have consisted of each side making truces<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
which were meant to be broken as soon as made.
Then, when he was twenty-three, his subjects ordered
their meek king to get him a wife, and after
a hunt with varying fortunes among all the princesses
of Western Europe who seemed likely to
suit, he selected Margaret of Anjou, an exceedingly
pretty and lively girl with whose portrait he
fell in love. She was then sixteen, and set off for
England with high hopes on both sides. Alas!
once more the pathetic tragi-comedy of poor Henry
VI’s life displayed itself; for the crossing was terribly
rough, and Margaret was desperately seasick.
Henry rushed to meet her, doubtless to see
if she was as pretty as her picture, but she had
caught chicken-pox on the ship and he had to
postpone the wedding until the pretty bride recovered.
Her experience was almost like that of
some English brides, who, reaching Melbourne,
have found the mosquitoes so attentive that they
have come on to Sydney a mere simulacrum of
the blooming fresh beauty that had got on board
the ship so hopefully at Tilbury Docks.</p>

<p>Six years later, when the Wars of the Roses
were coming into full blast and England was rent
in twain by quarrels among aristocratic families
which were only to be settled by the rise of the
heavy-handed Tudors, she bore him his only son;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
but the effort was disastrous not to her, but to
poor young Henry himself. The anxiety, both
over her and over his distracted country, had
driven him “melancholy,” and he developed well-marked
melancholia.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> While the king lay helpless
and silly, unable even to take cognisance of
his new-born son when Margaret held it up to him,
Margaret took the leadership of England into her
own strong hands.</p>

<p>One cannot help wondering how Margaret got
on with the nursing. As she was just about to become
a mother herself she could not have been
very strong; certainly not strong enough to nurse
a great big helpless baby as well as her own tiny
pink little new-born. Probably she got the duchess
of this or the countess of that to do the bulk of
the work—for nursing is hard work. There is far
more in it than merely fanning a fevered brow
and talking romantic nonsense to a helpless man.
One often sees two little energetic women go to
a bedside, grasp a sick man where it will not hurt
him, and then in the twinkling of an eye, he, a
mass of incarnate pain, has been moved to an entirely
new position with never a twinge. But—they
are <i>professional</i> nurses; it has taken them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
years to learn the little trick. It does not come
to woman by a special gift of God. The most
fervent wifely devotion does not compensate for
its absence. We saw a great deal of these aristocratic
amateur nurses during the war; there was a
certain royal lady who sometimes used to help me
at operations in London, and a great big kind-hearted
smiling woman she was, though not very
intelligent. But if she made a blunder—and it
was never very serious—she always passed it off
with so happy a smile that we always overlooked
it.</p>

<p>If my reading of Queen Margaret’s character is
correct she was a very determined though not very
wise young woman, and if her assistant made a
bad break doubtless she felt the rough edge of
the queen’s tongue. But the main thing was that
poor silly young Henry recovered and his wife
was able to get on with her war without being
worried by anything worse than the normal
troubles of a nursing mother.</p>

<p>If she had been a woman before, nursing her
saintly husband as if he had been her son, she became
a tigress now that she had a real son of her
own to fight for; and we have a vivid picture of
her raising an army for the House of Lancaster:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Many assembled for love they bare to the
king, but more for the fear they had for the queen,
whose countenance was so terrible and whose look
was so fearful that to all men against whom she
took a small displeasure her frouning was their undoing
and her indignation was their death.”</p>

</div>

<p>Could this furious mænad have been the same
as the pretty girl who landed, eager, seasick, and
ready for chicken-pox, just before her wedding?</p>

<p>We need not go through the whole melancholy
history of the Wars of the Roses, which were
really just the fifteenth-century murderous way of
holding a general election, but without even our
modern profession of principles. Everybody
knows how Edward IV became king in one of the
temporary lulls, how Henry VI, after another attack
of melancholia, was captured in spite of the
efforts of his strenuous wife; and how, at the
battle of Bosworth Henry VII killed his rival
Richard of Gloucester, and at last began modern
history with the iron rule of the Tudors. Many
of us have been to St. Albans, and will be interested
in the two particularly savage elections that
were held in that city; by a strange misnomer they
have been called battles. The wounded used to
run into the vast old cathedral for shelter while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
the election raged furiously up and down the
pleasant streets of that dear old town. Of all the
houses that looked down upon the fighting and resounded
to the roar of the newly invented cannon
I suppose that the only ones still standing are the
cathedral itself and the ancient hostelry at which
so many of us have had afternoon tea.</p>

<p>Edward IV imprisoned poor hapless Henry for
years; but at last the redoubtable Warwick the
Kingmaker restored the rightful—and by that
time melancholic and imbecile—monarch to the
throne, amid general rejoicings. His second reign
lasted only ten months, terminating in the Tower.
There can be little doubt that Richard of
Gloucester murdered him privily therein. In
1910 his remains were dug up, and his thin light
skull was found with its remnants of hair still
plastered with blood.</p>

<p>It would appear that King Henry took to religion
as a means of escape from the miseries of
his youth. Probably he felt that in the Church
only could he see the slightest sign of sympathy
for little overthrashed boys.</p>

<p>He was the gentlest and most virtuous of men.
The most violent oath that even his worst sufferings
ever wrung from his lips was “Forsoothe and
forsoothe,” sometimes varied by “Fie for shame.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
Queen Margaret could have done better. Once
he fled from a ball because the clothes of the ladies
displayed more than he thought proper. But
even the fury of Margaret could not protect him
when Richard Hunchback found him in the way.</p>

<p>Henry’s obsessions took the form of impulsive
and senseless generosity to his supposed friends,
and of singing unduly loudly in church. Though
he was meek enough, Richard of Gloucester
showed him that he could not inherit the earth,
and according to some religions Margaret, being
a woman, would never have been allowed to show
him the way past the golden gate into the kingdom
of heaven.</p>

<p>Poor, gentle, virtuous Henry; so well-meaning,
yet so overwhelmed by the sense of his sin!</p>

<p>And poor tigerish Margaret of Anjou! If she
had had sense enough to “come in out of the wet”
we might now be saying “Good Queen Peggy”
instead of “Good Queen Bess.” But how can
you expect a woman to show common sense and
self-restraint when she knows they are attacking
her only son? They killed him at last at Tewkesbury
almost before her eyes, and thenceforward
Margaret became a very tigress and was always
intriguing with Louis XI to avenge herself upon
the Yorkists.</p>

<p>“Know syphilis in all its manifestations and
relations, and all other things clinical shall be
added unto you.”—<span class="smcap">Osler.</span></p>

</div>

<p>It is extraordinary what a popular aversion
there seems to be to the idea that this man
had syphilis, and that many of his actions were
due to his syphilis. To judge by the number of
letters that I have received from both England
and America one would be inclined to think that
he was suffering from measles. This I interpret
in two ways: firstly, that people still cling to the
idea that syphilis is a “loathsome disease”; secondly,
that they do not wish to have their pet
ideal of a monster rationally explained in medical
terms. As a matter of fact, syphilis is far
more than a loathsome disease of skin and bone;
it would be quite as reasonable to call it often<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
a very grim disease of brain, mind, soul and body.
Since the general use of mercury its skin and bone
manifestations have sunk into comparative harmlessness,
and since the general use of the arseno-benzol
compounds the disease seems to have become
still less dangerous to the body; but there
is always before us the fact that it may be a very
terrible affliction for mind and nervous tissues.
But people love to hug their little delusions,
and so long as they cling to the idea that it is only
a “loathsome disease,” so long will syphilis continue
to destroy the flower of the human race—hard-working
intellectual middle-aged men who
once upon a time were very human youths.</p>

<p>And there seems to be a misconception about its
hereditary nature. The child of a syphilitic may
be apparently healthy in appearance, though its
resistance to other diseases may be low; it would
need a blood examination by Wassermann’s test
to make sure that its troubles were really syphilitic.
It need not necessarily show the classical
symptoms of “snuffles,” wasting, and rash. All
that may happen is that its whole body resisting
power is damaged, and it falls a prey to one or
other of the innumerable disease germs that are
always ready to attack us.</p>

<p>Furthermore, so virulent is sectarian prejudice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
that almost every single point about Henry’s life
seems still to be in dispute. If anybody could tell
me a safe track through the maze of conflicting
accounts of the reign of Henry Tudor, between
the modern feminists who still cling to the idea
that he was an unspeakable monster, the Roman
Catholic Church which still paints him as the very
devil, Froude who hailed him as the great Protestant
hero of the Reformation, and the accounts of
the ordinary man who looks upon him as a bloodthirsty
spot of grease—I believe Charles Dickens
used that elegant description—I should welcome
it; but as I have no criterion of truth but what
medical experience has shown me to be true of
men, women and disease, I can only follow the
account of him given by Professor Pollard, who,
treating him with studied moderation, was prepared
to consider him as the “great Erastrian,”
the protagonist of State against Church. No
doubt that is substantially true. It is not for a
doctor to say.</p>

<p>Even the number of premature births endured
by his wives is in dispute; and all sorts of cock-and-bull
stories are made up to show that his
children, if born alive, or his wives if they took
ill were singularly subject to the effects of cold
and overlong christenings. Once would be all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
very well; but when it happens more than once
it becomes suspicious. It is wonderful what
people can invent when they wish to explain a
thing by religious and political conspiracies—of
which they can really <i>know</i> nothing in an age so
utterly different from ours, in which the actors
have long gone beyond our intimate knowledge—when
the obvious medical truth is staring them
in the face. Human beliefs have changed, but
syphilis is still the same.</p>

<p>I follow Pollard because he impresses me as a
man of common sense. I have not met him; but
the sheer virulent abuse of the ordinary man is no
argument and is a better description of the critic’s
own mind than of his subject.</p>

<p>The facts which can only reasonably be explained
by the idea that he was suffering from constitutional
syphilis are as follows—I put them in
the order in which they impress myself:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>(<i>a</i>) The extraordinary number of premature
births and dead children from two of his wives,
one of whom was young and healthy. The early
death of Catherine’s first-born son is attributed to
the strain of a long christening on a bitter midwinter
day.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The poor health of at least three of his
children, Mary Tudor, Edward VI, and the illegitimate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Duke of Richmond; whether Elizabeth
escaped the infection is at least doubtful since
Professor Chamberlain has carefully investigated
the details of her health.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The terrible degeneration, mental, moral,
and physical, which set in in his early middle age.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The facts contained in the extract from
the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of 1910: “From being
an able and athletic man he had become a mass
of loathsome infirmities. He was bloated in face
and so unwieldy that he could hardly pass through
an ordinary door. His legs were swollen and
covered with festering sores, causing an unbearable
stench. Towards the end those about him
saw that death was at hand, though, according
to Foxe, he would never allow it to be mentioned
in his hearing. Kings never seem to have liked
it to be recognised that they are mortal, in which
reluctance to face facts they are much like other
people.”</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The sinus in his leg which caused him unbearable
agony whenever it was closed. This
seems to have been syphilitic periostitis occurring
in an essentially neurotic man.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Death in stupor at the comparatively early
age of fifty-five.</p>

</div>

<p>Not any single one of these symptoms is indubitable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
evidence of syphilis, but taken altogether
there is no other reasonable explanation.
In syphilis and self-indulgence we have the secret
of the whole tragic development of this king’s
character. Syphilis alone would doubtfully have
accounted for it, even less perhaps gluttonous and
bibulous self-indulgence. It is quite true that
after his first marriage he seems to have abandoned
all moral restraint, or at least guidance by ecclesiastics
and the Church; but his dreadful degeneration
was not a result of doing so; he did so
because he was influenced by the spirochæte and
gluttony combined. To-day, when a man gets
into gaol for any particularly shameless offence—especially
sexual—the very first thing that the
police surgeon does is to perform a Wassermann
test upon his cerebro-spinal fluid; and I am perfectly
certain that if it were possible to do so upon
Henry Tudor, the report would come back marked
“Wassermann plus,” and probably towards the
end of his life “plus plus plus!”</p>

<p>But when did he catch it? He does not seem
to have <i>obviously</i> infected any of his wives, so
far as we can tell, so the inference is that he must
have caught it several years before he married
Catherine of Aragon. Well, he married her when
he was little more than eighteen, so he must have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
caught it when he was thirteen or fourteen, at
about the very earliest that a gay and showy
boy of the Renaissance could manage to catch it.
Then probably the primary lesion, so apparently
innocent and harmless, healed up under the influence
of some simple ointment,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> just as it does
to-day in thousands of men, who bitterly rue later
the one little slip that was to cause them all their
woes—and Henry went his life through, probably
having quite forgotten the trifling incident.
To this day we find that those cases of syphilis
which are trifling at first, are just the very cases
which, under the influence of worry, lack of treatment,
or overstrain, go so tragically wrong at
the end. The somewhat wicked pun is common
among medical men: “Five minutes with Venus
may mean a lifetime with Mercury,” a specimen
of sardonic jesting with death that so appeals to
many doctors, however kindly and serious they
may really be.</p>

<p>In no way can we better trace his degeneration
than in his treatment of his wives; so I propose
to describe it alone of all his innumerable misdeeds.</p>

<p>Firstly, it is a great mistake to suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
the only nervous result of syphilis is general paralysis.
Among neurotic people it may cause
serious mental troubles although it may not affect
the actual brain-tissue so far as we can see with a
microscope. As this is perhaps not generally
known, I quote a sentence from the <i>Oxford Textbook
of the Practice of Medicine</i>, by various
authors, published in 1922. “Such patients are
generally psychasthenic, ill-balanced and degenerate.”
The writer is speaking of the effects of
syphilis upon mental diseases, and its propensity
to cause “phobias” and “obsessions.”</p>

<p>His first wife was Catherine of Aragon, who
was some six years older than himself. After a
fierce struggle with the pope the obliging Archbishop
Cranmer pronounced a divorce between
them. Martin Hume considers that this was entirely
for personal reasons, because she had lost
her personal charms, and because Henry had fallen
in love with Anne Boleyn. Probably there was
a great deal of the personal element in it, and it
is quite possible that if Catherine had been willing
to go into a convent and leave her husband
to another woman—he actually proposed that the
pope should allow him two wives—there might
not have been the divorce that has been fruitful
of such stupendous results for England. Catherine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
seems to have been a woman much under the
influence of Spanish religiosity, and undoubtedly
put up a strenuous fight to keep her husband; as
was only right and proper. Probably the real degeneration
in the king was yet to come; the spirochæte
was still biding its time.</p>

<p>Since there seems to be a good deal of doubt
about the exact dates of the famous premature
births of Catherine, I give from Professor Pollard
her actual record. On January 31st, 1510, seven
months after marriage, she gave birth to a daughter
still-born. Eleven months later, on January
1st, 1511, there was a son, who died in three days,
as is still said because of the inordinate length
of his christening. In September, 1513, there
was another son, who was either still-born, or died
immediately after it was born. In June, 1514,
there was yet another son, but he, too, was no
sooner christened than dead. Then, on February
18th, 1516, came the little Princess who, being
born to misery, became “Bloody Mary.” Then,
in 1517 “it is probable that there were several
miscarriages.” On November 18th, 1518, came
the last of the unhappy woman’s efforts. It was
a boy and still-born. And Catherine was by now
forty years of age and obviously could have no
more children. She had done her best, poor lady,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
but found her husband’s spirochætes too much
for her.</p>

<p>General experience is that the tendency in constitutional
syphilis is to cause a string of prematurely
born children or miscarriages; then a child
born at full time, but showing evidences of disease;
then, the tendency having worn itself out,
one or more backward but seemingly healthy children.
But, after Mary was born, apparently the
tendency still remained. Probably local internal
trouble still persisted in Catherine, and she had
not entirely worn out the infection. Undoubtedly
a good modern surgeon would have cured her and
altered the history of England. That the stout-hearted
daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella actually
died of the syphilis which she had probably
gained from her husband would appear to be
shown by the account of the post-mortem examination
which was secretly held by a man who
was trying to prove that Henry VIII had poisoned
her. He reported after getting the body ready
for embalming, that she was all sound but the
heart, which was “black and hideous, with a black
excrescence which clung closely to the outside.”
Doubtless this represented an aortic aneurysm,
which is known to be a common result of untreated
syphilis. I know that the findings have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
been attributed to cancer of the heart; but cancer
of the heart is so rare, if it ever occurs, while
aneurysm is so common, that I prefer the interpretation
here given.</p>

<p>I regret that my little essay on Henry’s second
wife, Anne Boleyn, has been much misunderstood
by readers of <i>Post Mortem</i>. The view I there
took was that if the stories about her were true
they could only be explained by the supposition
that she was suffering from nymphomania.
Nymphomania does not necessarily imply that a
girl is of abandoned character; it is a pathological
condition of the nervous system. To this day it
sometimes comes on after childbirth, especially
if accompanied by terror and anxiety. It is in
these women part of the Curse of Eve.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It may
happen to any woman, and sometimes causes scandal
before it is discovered. What circumstances
could be imagined more terrible than those in
which the tragic second queen found herself.</p>

<p>Henry had married her in hopes of gaining a
son and heir in spite of the curse which people
believed lay upon him for the multifarious premature
births of her predecessor, or rather for the
mortal sin of marrying his deceased brother’s wife.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
Still further to complicate the matter, Catherine
of Aragon had sworn that she had never had connection
with the dead Prince Arthur at all. Truly
the whole thing becomes more and more complex
as we gaze. A canon law which looked upon a
carnal act as a deed which must be sanctified by
God whenever it was performed, either before or
after marriage; a girl who desired to be queen;
another older woman who fought fiercely for her
rights as both wife and religious fanatic; a multitude
of fierce partisans; racial, political, and religious
animosities; over all a man enraged by
“love,” fear, and brutality. Who could get at
the truth about poor little Anne’s marriage? It
is impossible; one can only sympathise with everybody,
and try to understand.</p>

<p>As I said, if the stories are true they can only
be explained on pathological grounds. What girl
in her senses would go rushing about the Court
soliciting promiscuously in the manner of which
Anne is accused? Mr. Philip W. Sergeant has
written a book to prove that all the stories are
really based upon slanders set agoing by Chapuys,
ambassador of Charles V; and it was to fierce religious
and political animosity that Anne owed
her bad reputation. According to him she was
really a rather vindictive, free-spoken woman, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
great worker with her hands, fond of dress, musical,
and passionately fond of dancing. This is a
new outlook on the Anne of Froude and most historians,
but is confirmed by several known facts.
For instance, some of her laborious needlework is
said to be still preserved in Hampton Court Palace.
I have not seen it, for it is many years since
I was at that palace; but it must be very sad to
gaze upon it and think how tragic was the fate
of Mr. Sergeant’s dancing, singing, industrious
little queen.</p>

<p>Another thing upon further reflection rather
casts doubt even on the pathological explanation.
Froude accused her of soliciting Sir Henry Norreys
after the birth of Elizabeth—if I remember
rightly, it was less than three weeks afterwards.
Is it conceivable that Sir Henry Norreys would
be allowed alone into Her Majesty’s sick-room
only three weeks after the greatest event of any
woman’s life—the birth of her first-born?</p>

<p>A lady who claims to be an Irish descendant of
that George Boleyn who was accused of adultery
and incest with Anne has written a long and interesting
letter concerning her family and Anne in
particular. Narrating the family traditions—and,
as she says, family traditions must always be accorded
great value—she tells me that the descendants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
of George Boleyn hold strongly that Anne
may have been a gay little flirt, but that there
was never anything really morally wrong with
her; and that the whole accusation was in her own
words—she is an American—a “frame-up” on the
part of Henry VIII and Thomas Cromwell. Quite
possibly, therefore, Anne may really have given
nothing more than nods and becks and wreathed
smiles to the men who were accused of adultery
with her; possibly even the musician, Mark
Smeaton, may have had his confession wrung
out of him entirely by torture and by Cromwell’s
terrible personality.</p>

<p>The truth about her burial seems to be that she
was not bundled into a cask as I heard from one
of the caretakers at the Tower, but that she was
hurriedly put into a partly filled box of arrows.
According to Mr. Sergeant they dug up the box
in 1876 and found her delicate skeleton, with
slender bones and severed neck. It is all very
tragic and very sad. The difficulty is that Cromwell
seems to have taken care that all the evidence
in her favour perished. We do not hear from her
friends.</p>

<p>It was apparently during Queen Anne Boleyn’s
reign that the first appearance began of that
frightful physical degeneration in the King which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
so impressed all his contemporaries; and it was
probably from that circumstance that Anne gained
the discredit of being the great prime mover in his
degeneration; it was not fair of Mr. P. C. Yorke,
in the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, to say that she
appealed only to his lower nature. Some woman
when he was about fourteen had done so most
effectually, and years later Anne had to suffer for
it. He probably appealed to Anne through his
music, for he was a skilled musician, and one of
the anthems which he wrote is still performed in
English cathedrals.</p>

<p>There are still one or two things to remark when
dealing with Anne Boleyn. First of all there was
the birth of Elizabeth when she expected and fervently
prayed for a son; secondly, the next was a
miscarriage, said to have been brought on by seeing
Jane Seymour sitting on her husband’s knee;
another account is that it was a son prematurely
born through anxiety because of a fall that he had
when riding. Again these premature births! One
would have thought that the constitutional syphilis
in Henry VIII must have long worn itself out
by that time!</p>

<p>Last of all we must glance at the conduct of
the very obliging Archbishop Cranmer. He pronounced
the decree of divorce—which, by the way,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
neither Catherine nor Henry himself ever seems to
have recognised. Then he was present when
Anne and Henry were married secretly. Then,
when Anne, looking upon him as a friend, appealed
to him in her desperate trouble at the end,
he sent her a non-committal answer. As Mr. Sergeant
dryly comments, it has only recently been
proposed that this obliging man be made a saint
of the Anglican Church.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt of the reason why
Henry married Jane Seymour. Before he got
Anne put out of harm’s way he had fallen in love,
as he called it, with Jane; and the Seymours,
being very powerful people who, observing that
the king’s passions were already all-powerful
with him (owing to his illness), took advantage
of them to see that he married the new star, simply
for the sake of their own particular sect, which
happened to be Catholic. Here we see at once the
fact that Henry, who thought himself so strong,
was in reality already at the mercy of party
politics.</p>

<p>Jane Seymour seems to have been a nondescript
sort of woman, gentle and harmless. At the end
of about a year she was delivered of the little
son who, because his father’s syphilis had seemingly
worn itself out, passed through the perils<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
of his infancy only to die ultimately of what looks
very much like pulmonary tuberculosis, the other
curse of the Tudors. Childbirth killed the colourless
Jane Seymour, undoubtedly through puerperal
septicæmia, though once again the cock-and-bull
story of an overlong christening has been
revived.</p>

<p>Next came Anne of Cleves, the famous “great
Flanders mare” of legendary reputation, of whom
we have all learned at school. Again, according
to Major Hume, Henry was so worked upon by
his political advisers that he for once made an
utter fool of himself, and married a picture by
Holbein procured by Thomas Cromwell. In recommending
this marriage Cromwell took a great
risk, for, as is well known, no man can select
either wife, pipe or hat for another. It is said that
Henry had proposed to the French ambassador
that he should hold a sort of Babylonian marriage-market
among the damsels of France, whence he
should select the prettiest; but it is also said, by
Professor Pollard this time, that the Frenchman
made such an answer that for the only recorded
time in his life, Henry was seen to blush. It is
difficult to imagine such a jape—even if French—as
would make Henry Tudor blush.</p>

<p>The important thing to tell about Anne of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
Cleves is that Henry, having passed several nights
in her room, proclaimed that he had discovered
that she was not <i>virgo intacta</i>. There are also
several indecent stories that he was said to have
related of her, but as they are not entirely germane
to my present object, and as I do not wish this to
be a mere <i>chronique scandaleuse</i> I omit them.</p>

<p>While he was thus uncertain, being almost in
the position of Hajji Baba when he discovered
that he had married a veiled woman who turned
out to be excessively plain, Henry again strove
for freedom. He secured it by simply repudiating
his bride on the Euripidean method of “it was my
tongue that swore,” not my soul. Anne seems
to have been a good-natured sort of German frau
who accepted the inevitable with a good grace,
and doubtless she was not sorry to be left alone
with her knitting. Henry gave her £4,000 a year
and two country houses, and called her his sister.
She was not above cracking a risky joke with her
temporary husband when he became still more
prodigious as to his size and gluttony. It was
while he was worried about Anne that Luther announced
that Squire Harry thought himself to
be God.</p>

<p>Lady Catherine Howard was the most pitiful
of all, as Anne Boleyn was the most tragic. Once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
again there was the inevitable see-saw of politics;
Henry had got rid of Thomas Cromwell the
Protestant by the simple method of cutting off
his head in circumstances of unusual brutality
even for the sixteenth century; and once more the
Roman Catholics came on top. The result was
the sacrifice of pretty Catherine Howard. That
she was by far the best looking of all Henry’s
wives can hardly be denied. Nobody looking at
her gentle and thoughtful little face in the portrait
that hangs in the National Portrait Gallery
would ever dream that she was so immoral as
people tried to prove. Her eyes were hazel, her
hair was auburn; and she looks as virginal as
though she had never been near the Court. Yet
she was said to have had entanglements with at
least three men. She had had a very unhappy
childhood, and received due thrashings from her
aunt the Duchess of Norfolk when that lady took
a fancy to bestow them; but little education. She
had no maternal supervision to keep her on the
straight and narrow path in that sinful Court.
Her music master, Mannock, boasted that she had
promised to be his mistress; a kinsman named
Dereham said that she was his wife; and she was
reported to be engaged to her cousin, Culpepper.
And now she was bestowed upon this new and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
dreadful suitor, His Gracious Majesty<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> himself.
No wonder that Martin Hume became almost
dithyrambic about it. Indeed, Catherine Howard
had a hard fate.</p>

<p>I quote directly from Professor Pollard, who
mercifully glosses over the piteous details. “Rumours
of Catherine Howard’s past indiscretions
had at length reached the ears of the privy council....
Twenty-four hours later Cranmer put in
his hands the evidence of the queen’s misconduct.
Henry refused to believe it in the rude awakening
from his dreams; he ordered a strict investigation
to be made. Its results left no room for doubt.
Dereham confessed his intercourse; Mannock admitted
having taken liberties; and finally the
queen herself confessed her guilt. The king was
overwhelmed with grief and vexation, and shed
bitter tears. He offered his wife a pardon and
she might have escaped with nothing worse than
a divorce had not proofs come to hand of her misconduct
with Culpepper during Henry’s recent
absence in the north. This offence was high treason
and could not be covered by Henry’s pardon
for her prenuptial immorality.” Henry feared
lest the blood royal be contaminated. In January,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
1542, Parliament considerately relieved
this blubbering and neurotic man of his responsibility
by “passing an Act of Attainder directed
against his new wife, which, to save him pain, was
signed by a Commission in his stead. Catherine
declined his permission to go down to the house of
Parliament and defend herself in person.” In due
course she was beheaded in the Tower. The story
is that she said, “I had rather die a Culpepper
than live a Queen.” Doubtless in confessing at
the back of her mind was the thought that it were
better to be dead than to be married to King
Henry VIII at the moment that his mental syphilis
was approximating to its greatest terrors with
all its obsessions and phobias. Seemingly the Parliament
of England was not always so brave as
we now think it to be. But if he knew so much
about women as he had professed in the case of
his repudiation of Anne of Cleves, why had he
not applied his knowledge to the case of Catherine
Howard before?</p>

<p>It seems a reasonable thing to glance at the
other symptoms of syphilis that occurred at the
time during the reign of Catherine Howard when
his greatest degeneracy was coming on.</p>

<p>The ulcer on his leg sometimes closed, and the
pain was so intense that he sometimes became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
speechless with agony and went black in the face.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
He grew more and more corpulent every day.
When he went on progress to the north he cleared
the Tower by issuing orders that every prisoner
in it was to be beheaded. If these in an absolute
monarch are not symptoms of syphilitic psychasthenia,
of a frightful moral and physical degeneration,
what are they? Symptoms of whooping-cough,
perhaps!</p>

<p>Next and last came Catherine Parr, who was
said to have been degraded to the royal bed by
the Protestants to gain their own ends. She must
have been a brave woman to tackle the task of
nursing this man, whose temper by that time was
like that of a wild beast owing to his obsessions
and phobias. She was no beauty; she was short in
stature, but gifted with amazing tact. She had
already been twice a widow, so evidently she
thought she understood the art of nursing and
managing men, even such a man as her new husband.
She is said to have been at the time in
love with Sir Thomas Seymour, whom she married
after Henry’s death, only to die in a short
time of puerperal fever. She reconciled Henry
to his daughter, Elizabeth, and is said to have
kept the peace between her and the Princess Mary.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
We are told that she once had a theological dispute
with the king; a risky thing to do. “A good
hearing it is,” said Henry, “when women become
such clerks; and a fine thing it is to be taught in
mine old days by my wife.” Catherine explained
that what she had said was merely intended to
“minister talk”; so Henry answered, “Is it so,
sweetheart; then we are friends again,” and when
Lord Chancellor Wriothesley came to arrest her
Henry called him beast, knave and fool. She must
indeed have been a remarkably clever woman,
whatever her religious opinions.</p>

<p>As to his death it is quite impossible to get at
the real truth. He had sent the Duke of Norfolk
to the Tower and had ordered his execution to be
fixed for February 28th, 1546. But, alas, on
the 27th Henry lay dying. The exact details are
so squabbled over for purposes of sectarianism,
that it is impossible to distinguish between truth
and falsehood. It is said on the one side that he
died in an agony of conscience; on the other that
Archbishop Cranmer came to ask him to give some
token of his belief in Jesus Christ. The king is
said to have roused himself from his stupor and
pressed Cranmer’s hand. While there are not sufficient
details to offer an opinion it is possible
that his stupor was uræmic, due to the slow degeneration<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
of his kidneys during the many years
that his body and mind had been degenerating.
But one would prefer to have some independent
authority for the statement that the dying man
understood sufficient of what Cranmer was saying
to him to press his hand at the mention of the
blessed name of Christ.</p>

<p>To the best of my ability and in accordance
with the best modern historical knowledge, I have
drawn as honestly as I can the true character of
Henry VIII, Defender of the Faith, as seen by a
doctor. There are many stories told about him
that I purposely have omitted from fear of being
accused of exaggeration. But the general atmosphere
of lust, obscenity, grandiose ideas, such as
were noticed by Luther, and violence combined
with cowardice, especially about disease, is all
very typical of syphilis; one might almost call it
diagnostic. He never became an indecent honest
lunatic such as Ivan the Terrible, for ingenious
historians who know the exact circumstances so far
as anybody can know them at this time of day,
are still able to find logical reasons for even the
most dreadful of his actions. He did not become
terrible; he became loathsome. To use the words
of a witty journalist friend of mine he was not
Henry the Terrible; he was Henry the Horrible.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
He is the one man who ever disproved Shakespeare’s
vaunt:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“This England never did nor never shall</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lie at the proud feet of a conqueror.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For if England did not lie at the proud and
probably dropsical feet of this obsessional syphilitic
with doubtless a gigantic blood-pressure to
add to his bad temper, words have no meaning.</p>

<p>The whole conduct of the English people
throughout the Reformation is a beautiful example
of the working of Dr. Wilfrid Trotter’s
herd instinct. Like a swarm of bees England
swept this way and that, uncertain how to fly,
looking for a resting-place where it might start
the new era just as the swarm searches for a place
to start a new hive; and then, suddenly, with no
obvious reason, darts upon its way, upon the usual
English way of a compromise which doubtfully
satisfies the strongest party.</p>

<p>It adds to the remark of R. L. Stevenson’s cynical
old Frenchman: “The English are a stupid
people who have sometimes blundered into good.”</p>

<p>How many men lost their lives owing to
Henry’s syphilitic obsessions and phobias it is
quite impossible to say. The comparatively slight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
derangement of judgment in those tyrannical times
may have meant the block for scores. Perhaps
when Sir Thomas More said, “Her Majesty
Queen Anne Boleyn may dance and sing but her
turn may still shortly come,” the acutest mind in
England perceived that his king was not entirely
normal in mind.</p>

<p>Henry VIII was never a despot. If the law did
not allow him to do as he wished, he simply got
Parliament to alter it for him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Edward_VI">Edward VI</h2>

</div>

<p>This poor little boy, in whom all the tragedy
of the Tudors seems to have concentrated
itself, was born to Henry VIII and Queen Jane
Seymour in 1537. Henry had already forgiven
himself for his conduct to Anne Boleyn, and was
deeply attached to his new queen; during the
progress of the christening he sat by the side of
his wife and held her hand in order that she might
not be too exhausted by the strain. She, poor
thing, had to wear a great gown of ermine, and
to sit upright on a state pallet to welcome and
bless her little son as the service terminated. But
her loving arms could not save him; already within
him were implanted the seeds of death, a tuberculous
tendency from his grandfather, Henry VII,
and actual spirochetes from his father, Henry
VIII. And, as Queen Jane clutched him to her
bosom, she herself began to shiver; no doubt she
thought her shivering was from fear lest she lose
her son; but within a week of his birth she lay
dead, probably from puerperal septicæmia.
Henry was heart-broken; but at least the curse of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
the Church had been lifted; he could now honestly
say that he had begotten a legitimate and living
son, and that the succession of the English throne
was safe. Where the brilliant little Anne Boleyn
had failed, this commonplace and featureless
Queen Jane, so colourless that everybody liked
her, or at least did not hate her, had succeeded.
So she being dead, Henry at once communicated
with the Court of France in order to get him another
wife, if possible; that the Pope might see
how impotent he was to affect human destiny.
This was not because he was incurably lustful,
but because it was still important to have another
heir, should little Edward turn sick and die. Already,
one thinks, the English Prometheus was
scaling Olympus with determined, though engrossed,
footsteps; already Zeus might well
tremble at the ponderous footfalls of this fat and
syphilitic man.</p>

<p>But little Edward did not seem likely to die;
for, to all appearances he was a strong and healthy
little boy. If the Court of England had purposely
meant to deny that Edward was syphilitic
it could not have chosen better words to do it in,
for, as the message announcing the glad news of
his progress said, “he sucketh like a child of
puissance.” In the typical infantile hereditary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
syphilis the baby suffers from “snuffles,” and its
sucking powers are, to say the least, inadequate.
But the spirochæte has other ways of taking its
revenge upon its host. It may lie latent for years,
and so poison the child’s resisting powers that he
falls an easy victim to some deadly bacterium.
In the case of little Edward it seems to have been
the tubercle bacillus that first seized upon its
chance; and when, fifteen years later, just after
puberty, it was working its deadly will upon him
the spirochæte of syphilis joined the assault.</p>

<p>Edward was an affectionate little boy, of good
impulses. Of course it was unthinkable that a
prince should ever be flogged; so the fond father
appointed a whipping-boy to act vicariously in his
stead. It was Barnaby Fitzpatrick who was honoured
by receiving the royal thrashings, though
Edward was such a good little boy that Barnaby
was seldom called upon for duty, and grew up a
firm friend of the little king who might have suffered
in his person but for him. Edward’s wet-nurse
was a motherly woman whom he later called
his “mother-jak.” I do not know what childish
utterance that may have represented, but it is silly
enough a term to have come from the mouths of
babes and sucklings. At eleven months old no less
a personage than Thomas Cromwell visited him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
officially and, no doubt, dandled him upon his
knee. Says Cromwell’s secretary, speaking of this
time, “And I do assure your lordship that I never
saw so goodly a child of his age; so merry, so good
and loving a countenance, and so earnest an eye, as
it were exercising a judgment towards every person
who repaireth to his grace; and, as it seemeth
to me, his grace encreaseth well in the air where
he is.” (Already he had been sent to the country
for his health.) “And, albeit a little of his grace’s
flesh decayeth, yet he shooteth out in length and
waxeth firm and stiff and he can steadfastly
stand.” So clearly he was a nice little boy of
eleven months, if anything rather forward for his
age.</p>

<p>When he was about two, his father, the king,
used to take his little son in his arms and stand at
the window to show the multitude how bravely his
boy was fighting life; and the crowd would clap
and cheer for joy, for King Henry VIII was still
beloved, and the Tudor succession was at every
Englishman’s heart; the awful mental and physical
degeneration in the king was still to come,
and there is no more delightful scene in Henry
VIII’s life than that of him standing at the window
holding up his son to be cheered by the crowd.
How little we really know of our public men!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
Who could have foretold that this smiling king
was to become the most murderous tyrant who
ever sat upon the throne of England? For the
present let him be glad, and his little son with
him, smiling and chuckling with true Tudor tact.
The tragedy to both comes soon enough.</p>

<p>Some time before this, the proud wet-nurse announced
that her foster-child “has three teeth and
a fourth appeareth.” I cannot discover the exact
age at which this announcement was made. It
would be interesting to know whether his dentition
was entirely normal; but probably little Edward
seemed normal enough. When he came to be
educated the amount of learning that was stuffed
into that poor child’s head was simply amazing—worthy
of Elizabeth; worthy of bluff King Hal
himself. He could speak both Latin and Greek;
he habitually wrote in Latin, and could translate
a Latin author into Attic Greek. For his friend
he selected little Jane Dormer, a girl of his own
age; the two ran about and played together. The
two made a pretty picture, if you can forget the
fate that was hanging over the little boy. He
kept a journal, and a day came, April 2nd, 1552,
when he noted “this day I fell sick of the measles
and the smallpox.” The young diagnostician
must have been very sure of his insight. The fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
that two dissimilar eruptions came out on the
little boy at the same time rather seems to indicate
that there was some other toxin at work, probably
syphilitic.</p>

<p>As he grew up he began to show signs of both
obstinacy and religiosity, which, with a little
encouragement, might have become as fanatic as
those of Mary Tudor herself and led to a real
good old sixteenth-century religious persecution.
It was perhaps fortunate for England that the
clever little boy died before he could do any real
mischief. We know a great deal about his actual
death. For a long time his health had been failing;
he was racked with a constant and incurable
cough, and apparently showed all the symptoms
of a rapid consumption. The regular doctors having
failed to cure him, England’s Majesty was
entrusted to the care of a woman who professed to
have acquired possession of a cure-all. Under her
treatment the king became rapidly worse. “His
legs swelled, his complexion became sallow, his
hair fell out; the terminal joints of his fingers fell
off” (syphilitic dactylitis?). “Eruptions came
out on his skin, and he lost his fingers.” The luckless
laundress who washed his shirts also suffered
from terrible things; she lost her nails and the
skin off her fingers, which gave rise to the suspicion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
that some one had been trying to poison the
king her employer. But probably either she had
been using some cheap soap or else she had syphilis
herself. So, the quack having proved that her
cure-all was doing the king more harm than good,
was sent about her business, and the regular doctors
were recalled. Froude thought that she had
been using some mineral poison, and that in truth
Edward VI had actually been poisoned by her,
though not intentionally. As for me, I am quite
prepared to believe that she had somehow got hold
of a preparation of mercury which she was using
on the light-hearted assumption, which was probably
true, that in 1550 everybody was suffering
from syphilis, and that when she tried it on Edward’s
form, already wasted and powerless by the
long struggle with tuberculosis, the spirochætes
that had been lying latent within him suddenly
became active during the “storms of puberty” with
the terrifying results that we have just seen. Possibly
the woman may have bragged of her discovery
about mercury; and everybody would at once
say, “See what you are doing to our beloved
young king with your mineral poisons!” There
is much virtue in a name. Call mercury a
“mineral poison,” and it is at once damned as
much as if you had called it a “drug.” But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
vegetable poisons are far worse than mineral
poisons; yet nobody dreams of saying that we
should not take strychnine to “buck us up,” nor
morphine to relieve us of intolerable pain. Probably
it was that woman’s hard luck that she tried
mercury at the very moment when the king’s
latent syphilis was about to come to the surface;
and no doubt it was just such incidents as this
which have given to mercury such a bad name,
that the moment one prescribes it the patient
always says, “Not mercury, doctor, please.”</p>

<p>But that unfortunate woman was dismissed and
the regular practitioners returned to their prey
with the good old sixteenth-century remedies for
coughs, which, if they could not cure, would certainly
not bring the patient all out in a rash. The
rumour went about that they were poisoning the
king, that he was already dead. As young Edward
lay gasping and coughing and sweating on
his death-bed his attendants said to him that it
would be wise for him to let himself be seen; so,
with true Tudor sense of duty, he dragged himself
to the window and looked out at the crowd
waiting like ghouls to hear that he was dead.
When they saw his face, grey, pinched and dying,
the crowd cheered as it cheered when it saw
him held up in his father’s arms. Though some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
cheered, yet some held to it that a man who could
look so ghastly must be dead, and indeed the
rumour that he was dead was but confirmed by
the sight of him.</p>

<p>His last prayer was “O Lord God, free me, I
beseech you, from this calamitous life.” What
was that poor young lad doing that he had already
begun to wonder why he had ever been born, as
many men have wondered about themselves since
him? Tuberculosis of the lungs is often accompanied
by a sense of euphoria, that is to say, the
patient does not feel so ill as he should feel. But
syphilis of the lung is gloomy enough, and sometimes
gives rise to symptoms indistinguishable
from tuberculosis. On the whole, therefore, I
might rather be inclined to hazard a guess that it
was syphilis of the lung that killed little Edward
VI. I grant that this guess might be based mainly
on that sad prayer, coupled with all the other
symptoms that I have narrated. Then, after he
had been trying to look upon his subjects with
eyes that probably saw nothing, he suddenly cried,
“I faint—Lord, receive my soul,” and fell back
dead.</p>

<p>But is it not rather fantastic to summon either
in particular of the two Earthly Twins, tubercle
and syphilis, to the final assault, especially a manifestation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
of syphilis so rare as syphilis of the lung?
These two form an alliance when it occurs that is
not like the alliance of States; they do not quarrel,
but never let go their grip until the patient dies.
And it is in an alliance between delayed hereditary
syphilis and pulmonary tuberculosis that we must
probably seek for the death of Edward VI.</p>

<p>Probably it was lucky for him, and lucky for
England that he died; and he did well by wondering
why he was ever born. How much more violently
would the wonder of life have shocked him
when he came to learn how thorny is the path of
a man who is too religious! <i>Sed Dis aliter visum.</i>
It needed no inscrutable wisdom on the part of
the Almighty to realise that Edward Tudor was
“better dead.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Mary_Tudor">Mary Tudor</h2>

</div>

<p>I have already discussed the character of this
unhappy woman in <i>Post Mortem</i>. To the
psychology that I there enunciated I have nothing
to add; and I still believe that if she had not been
for so long an old maid, if she had not been neglected
by Philip II, or if she had been married, as
she probably would have preferred, to Charles V,
England would not have had occasion to call her
“Bloody Mary.” She but supplies another instance,
if one were needed, that religion and sex<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
are not far apart.</p>

<p>For details as to her physical health I am indebted
to the <i>British Medical Journal</i> for 1910,
where there appeared that noteworthy series of
articles on Royal Deathbeds which has been so
useful to historically minded doctors.</p>

<p>As a child she was always sickly, though as she
grew up she had to undergo the rigid mental discipline
that Henry enforced on all his children.
Being a very learned man himself, he naturally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
tried to imbue them with his own hunger for
knowledge; and all three rivalled their father in
intellectual endeavour.</p>

<p>With better fortune, better health, and perhaps
we might say with a less exacting father, Mary
might have been as great as he. Instead her really
great parts turned her into the road of tyranny
and persecution, and “Bloody Mary” she will remain
for all time.</p>

<p>The “storms of puberty” that had shattered the
frail barque of Edward VI, and brought his latent
spirochætes to the surface, beat hard upon Mary’s
body, and left her an embittered and sickly
woman, with an intellect below her station, and a
conscience above it. But what she mistook for the
love of God—religion—was probably a love more
fleshly; the desire of the moth for the star, as
Shelley puts it poetically. Indeed, it is difficult to
describe this primitive instinct in language that
shall not be poetical; the great brain of man has
idealised love until it is the emotion furthest from
prose that humanity is capable of suffering; and
that which is originally common to man and the
brutes becomes the noblest feeling of the human
brain; transcendental. And when again sublimated
it may lead to the fiercest of injustices, to
the most savage of religious persecutions. To<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
that goal it led Mary Tudor, the most unhappy
woman in English history.</p>

<p>As a girl she suffered from menstrual troubles
that caused her great pain; her normal menstruation
was often scanty; and this has been attributed
to overstudy. To this day we find that any overstrain,
or even a sudden change of climate, may
cause amenorrhœa in a young woman; many of
our English girl-immigrants, having left the
depths of an English summer for the mildness of
a Sydney winter, suddenly terrify their friends by
becoming amenorrhœic, often to their unfounded
mental distress. Later on she suffered from what
she called her “old guest,” of which the chief
symptom was amenorrhœa. The probability is
that soon after her marriage with Philip she really
did become pregnant, and miscarried. The disappointment
weighed heavily on her mind. Was it
possible that she, who was so earnest, virtuous and
religious, should be affected by the same curse as
the wives of her father? She became cachectic—that
is to say, her complexion assumed the ashy
hue of a person dying of cancer; and her abdomen
swelled as though she were again pregnant. Sir
Spencer Wells in 1877 hazarded the guess that
she probably suffered from “ovarian dropsy,” an
old-fashioned term for what we should now call<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
“parovarian cyst,” a tumour that takes its origin
from a little body adjacent to the ovary, and,
being distended with fluid, causes enormous swelling
of the abdomen. It is the one abdominal tumour
which, if tapped, may possibly not return,
and the patient may be cured with no further ado.</p>

<p>For years before she died she had suffered from
very bad health; she was never well, and could
never attend to her work properly, owing to the
terrible headaches that afflicted her; these were
possibly due to her bad eyesight. With these also
went palpitation of the heart. She never became
old, for she died at forty-two; and most likely
the proverb was as true with her as it still is with
every young person—“If you feel your heart, it
is not your heart; it is something else, generally
your stomach.”</p>

<p>It is quite true that she, like Charles V, felt the
loss of Calais desperately; her exact words to her
ladies-in-waiting were, “When I am opened you
will find Calais lying on my heart.” Probably the
fluttering at her heart put the idea into her head;
and equally probably that fluttering ultimately
came from her pelvic distress, which in turn would
doubtless cause indigestion. We often see similar
cases to-day.</p>

<p>Her father had compelled her to sign a statement<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
that his marriage with Catherine of Aragon
had been “by God’s law and man’s incestuous and
unlawful”; thereby forcing her to declare herself
a bastard. The parliament of her brother Edward
VI passed an Act of Uniformity that enjoined
services in English and did not permit of the Mass.
To Mary, as a devout Roman Catholic, this appeared
to be a form of persecution. She therefore
appealed to her cousin the Emperor who intervened
on her behalf, as he had tried to intervene
on behalf of her mother during the divorce.
But this time he was more successful, for he
threatened England with war unless Mary’s freedom
of worship was restored to her, and her right
of hearing Mass in her own chapel after the old
canons. It is easy to see that the great Tudor dictator
was dead and that only a sick woman sat on
his throne. But Mary seems to have had no approximately
impartial adviser. Throughout her
reign she had no one to help her but the Emperor,
who, great as he was, could not be called impartial
in those dreadful times.</p>

<p>She was by no means personally cruel; she was
lenient to political prisoners and restored out of
her own privy purse some of the monasteries
which her father had robbed. When her tumour—if
it was a tumour—returned, in 1557, she drew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
up a will in expectation of the dangers of childbirth.
She added a codicil to this in October,
1558, which showed that she had abandoned all
hope of children. Her husband had not returned
to her after he had gone to Belgium to see Charles
V abdicate, and the elderly wife at last saw that
no child of hers was to govern England.</p>

<p>In 1558 she suffered from what was then called
“the new burning ague,” which is now thought to
have been the influenza; in that year it was raging
in England, killing thousands of people.</p>

<p>She died suddenly in November, 1558, in full
possession of her mind, while she was hearing
Mass in her own private chamber, a right that she
had won after such bitter struggles. Although no
post-mortem examination was held, it is generally
thought that she died of an ovarian tumour,
though that is not likely to be correct, because an
ovarian tumour would not cause sudden death.
Nor is there any record of any sickness that would
cause a heart disease that might kill her suddenly,
unless perhaps the influenza may have weakened
her heart. I rather fancy that my own guess is
correct as given in <i>Post Mortem</i> that she died of
“degeneration of heart and arteries,” not necessarily
but probably syphilitic and inherited from
her father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<p>Any doctor looking at the portrait of her
wizened, lined, and prematurely aged face would
probably say, “That woman must have been a
hereditary syphilitic,” especially if he knew the
history of Henry VIII. I am surprised to see
that in the actual record of her life there appears
to be none of the usual symptoms of hereditary
syphilis beyond the general ill-health that was
hers all her days, poor creature. Doubtless the
illness in her father was working itself out by the
time that she was born.</p>

<p>But she was very short-sighted; and possibly,
as Sir Clifford Allbutt points out, this may have
been due to “interstitial keratitis,” an affection of
the cornea of the eye which is almost confined to
hereditary syphilitics. So that in Mary also we
see the effects of the “tragedy of the Tudors.”
I am certain that that wizened face must come
from hereditary syphilis, because one of the first
patients I ever had looked extraordinarily like
Mary Tudor, and the swellings on her arms for
which she consulted me melted rapidly under the
influence of mercury. Her photograph lies in my
desk to this day as a perfect illustration of delayed
hereditary syphilis.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Queen_Elizabeth">Queen Elizabeth</h2>

</div>

<p>No decent man would add to the slanders that
have been passed upon this extraordinary
woman, who stood at the head of the English
nation when it was engaged in one of its fiercest
struggles for very existence. These slanders are
so numerous in quantity, but in quality so much
alike, that they may all be summed up in one—slander
against her sexual morality. Professor
Chamberlin<a href="#Endnote_2">(2)</a>, evidently considering that the
morals of a great queen of the sixteenth century
should resemble those of a great queen of the nineteenth,
spent many years in ascertaining the nature
of the sicknesses from which she was said to
have suffered. The farrago of somewhat quackish-sounding
symptoms that he discovered has no
meaning in modern medicine. She has been slandered
quite enough, poor lady, and I for one shall
not add anything to it. Rather than seek an explanation
for the innumerable contemporary physiological
slanders I propose to see whether they
are possible.</p>

<p>They may be said to have been summed up by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
the kindest, most gentle and most sympathetic of
historians, Professor A. F. Pollard<a href="#Endnote_1">(1)</a>, whose
immense industry and meticulous fairness will at
once absolve him from any obvious conscious bias,
sectarian or otherwise. Writing of her extraordinary
juggling with her numerous suitors he says:
“There is evidence that she had no option in the
matter and that a physical defect precluded her
from hopes of issue. On this supposition her
conduct becomes intelligible, her irritation at parliamentary
pressure on the subject pardonable,
and her outburst on the news of Mary Stuart’s
motherhood a welcome sign of genuine feeling.
Possibly there was a physical cause for Elizabeth’s
masculine mind and temper, and for the curious
fact that no man lost his head over her as many
did over Mary Queen of Scots. To judge from
portraits, Mary was as handsome as her rival; but
apparently Elizabeth had no feminine fascination,
and even her extravagant addiction to the outward
trappings of her sex may have been due to the
absence or atrophy of deeper feminine feelings.
The impossibility of marriage made her all the
freer with her flirtations, and she carried some of
them to lengths which scandalized a public unconscious
of Elizabeth’s real security.”</p>

<p>To analyse such remarkable slanders as those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
passed by Mary Queen of Scots<a href="#Endnote_3">(3)</a>, and many
years after Elizabeth’s death by Ben Jonson<a href="#Endnote_4">(4)</a>
in his tipsy tattling would need a paper more
suited for a gynæcological journal than for general
publication. Without emulating Ben by going
into unpleasant physical details I content myself
by saying that so far as I know there is <i>no</i> physical
defect of the female form obvious to the sufferer
which will preclude hope of offspring, and yet
allow her to reach the age of nearly seventy.
Before coming to that conclusion the author laid
down four postulates to himself<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> which will occur
to every critically minded doctor; and it seems to
him that every suggestion fails miserably in at
least one of these postulates. And since, when
tested in this way, every slander founded on the
physical appearance of her body necessarily fails,
it is equally possible that the suspicions thus based
may be equally without foundation. Such rumours
about her are founded upon a lamentable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
want of knowledge of woman’s physiological and
anatomical necessities.<a href="#Endnote_11">(11)</a></p>

<p>It seems to me, that we can gather better evidence
from contemporary portraits than from contemporary
religious slanders; it is well known that
whenever sixteenth-century religion came in at
the door objective truth flew out at the window.
No one can study the beautiful portrait of Queen
Elizabeth which Miss Gwen John allows me to
publish without thinking: “That is not the portrait
of a loose woman! She may have been cruel,
vindictive, merciless, but she cannot have been
loose and sensual.”</p>

<p>Her amazing personality is best explained by
the new science of the ductless glands—endocrinology.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
Sometimes she seems to have had all
the male qualities, such as swearing, roughness of
speech, freedom from convention. Sometimes she
seems to have behaved like a doting old maid, in
her inordinate love of dress, jewellery, and flattery.
Rather than believe that she was abnormal
in form, which I think to be impossible considering
the known facts of her physiology, I find it
easier to believe that in some way her “endocrine
balance” was abnormal. It is now rather more
than suspected that no individual is entirely male<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
or entirely female; the psychic qualities of both
sexes are more or less mingled in everybody, and
thus we could easily explain the remarkable fact
noted by Professor Pollard that no man ever seems
to have fallen in love with Elizabeth sufficiently
to risk his head for her. A century before, Owen
Tudor fell in love with Katherine of Valois<a href="#Endnote_7">(7)</a>,
and risked death by marrying her secretly. But
no such vehement lover appeared for Elizabeth;
and, if he had, her want of “endocrine balance”
would not have prevented her from child-bearing.
When she shouted to Sir Nicholas Throckmorton,
“God’s death, villain, I’ll have thy head,”<a href="#Endnote_3">(3)</a> the
violence of the male in her came to the surface;
when she fondled and fooled with the Duke of
Alençon and called him her “little frog”<a href="#Endnote_6">(6)</a> and
other silly names, the doting old maid in her was
paramount. Major Hume considers that it was
with the Duke of Alençon that Elizabeth was in
love for the first and only time in her life; and it
is quite possible.</p>

<p>The only thing that my speculation does not
explain is the bitter cry from the heart that was
wrung from her when she heard of the birth of
King James I to her great rival, Mary Queen of
Scots: “The Queen of Scots is the lighter of a fair
son, but I am a barren stock!”<a href="#Endnote_3">(3)</a> How did she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
know? Was she thinking of the amazing number
of miscarriages that befell two of her father’s
wives, which to us now appear such certain evidence
that he was probably suffering from constitutional
syphilis? That is the best suggestion I
am able to make.</p>

<p>Innumerable attempts have been made to explain
the slanders upon Queen Elizabeth, from
Miss Gwen John’s explanation given in her little
play, “The Prince,”<a href="#Endnote_12">(12)</a> that probably they arose
from accidental episodes that occurred when she
was about her normal duties at Court, to Major
Hume’s idea—which is generally held—that they
were the result of purposeful “hoaxing” by the
Great Queen, all done for the sake of her country.
True, like her father Henry VIII, Elizabeth was
very patriotic; but, as one of Professor Chamberlin’s
doctors suggests, it is difficult to distinguish
between her patriotism and her desire to keep her
own head on her shoulders. So far as I know the
present suggestion—that the contemporary rumours
about her physical malformation were impossible—has
never been put forward before. It
again leaves the field open for those who are able
to estimate the effects of sectarian enthusiasm
upon the human mind to find some other explanation
than a physical malformation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>Her character has been so much besmirched by
slander that we are sometimes apt to forget that
in reality she was as clever and intellectual as her
great father in his youth. She knew several languages,
and to seek consolation in the worries that
necessarily befell her it is said that she translated
Boëthius’ “Consolatio Philosophiæ.”<a href="#Endnote_9">(9)</a></p>

<p>If we are to remember her as the man-struck old
maid who philandered with and petted her favourites,
it is equally well for us to remember her as
the intellectual woman who was able to translate
a deep philosophical work. The extremely intellectual
qualities that one finds in Elizabeth are
sometimes forgotten in the whirlwind of sectarian
slander and patriotism that had centred itself on
her head. Possibly the reason why she fixed upon
Boëthius for translation—he had already been
done by Chaucer—is because he wrote his great
“consolation” in prison while he was awaiting the
Roman executioner. Perhaps she thought that his
case somewhat resembled her own.</p>

<p>Her dual personality came out strongly in her
last words. According to Sir Sidney Lee they
were “Ad inferos eat melancholia”—“To hell
with melancholy.” Not long afterwards she fell
into a deep coma<a href="#Endnote_10">(10)</a>—probably caused by septic
intoxication from an abscess in her tonsils, acting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
upon a woman whose arteries were much older
than her years—and died in her sleep. In these
words one sees the reckless courage that we suppose
to be male, swearing and laughing in the
face of death however unwelcome he may be, and
the feminine desire to charm which led her to
paint her face as she said them.</p>

<p>But after all, the best epitaph upon Elizabeth
is the little verse that she scratched upon a windowpane
at Woodstock Manor, where her loving
sister Mary was “entertaining” her much as we
entertained Napoleon at St. Helena:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Much is suspected of me;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nothing proved can be;</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">Elizabeth prisoner.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And perhaps it is as well that nothing can be
proved against the personal morality of one of
the greatest women in history. One imagines that
her wraith would laugh ironically at all our vain
efforts, as her young girlhood evidently laughed
at poor Mary as she scratched the words <i>Elizabeth
prisoner</i>.<a href="#Endnote_5">(5)</a></p>

<p>I take from the <i>British Medical Journal</i> of
1910 the description of her actual death, because
it is in accordance with my own experience of the
deaths of fierce and obstinate old ladies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>Lady Southwell, one of her maids of honour,
said: “She kept her bed for fifteen dayes besides
the three dayes that she sat upon her stool without
speaking; until one day, being pulled upon
her feet by force, she stood upon her feet for
fifteen hours. Her Majestie understood that Mr.
Secretarie Cecil had given forth that she was mad;
and therefore in her sickness she said ‘Cecill, know
thou that I am not mad; you must not try to
make Queen Jane of me.’” Queen Jane was
“Crazy Jane,” mother of Charles V, and this recollection
of the days of her youth, when Charles
V was the greatest man in the world, is very characteristic
of an old person. “And,” continues
Lady Southwell, “though by Cecil’s means many
stories were spread about that she was mad, myself,
nor anie that were about me, could never see
that her speeches, so well adapted, proved her
distracted mind.”</p>

<p>Then they lifted her into bed; she fell asleep;
and the last of the great personal monarchs of
England died in coma. There was no sectarian
nonsense about her waking from a stupor to press
anybody’s hand, when all she wanted was to get
on with her dying.</p>

<p>But though Elizabeth was so great and had
such an astonishing effect on English history<a href="#Endnote_8">(8)</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
it would be a mistake to turn her into the heroine
of a sentimental novel.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Ivan_the_Terrible">Ivan the Terrible</h2>

</div>

<p>The life of this criminal lunatic has been
described so often, with so much journalistic
horror, that I hesitate to offer the plain matter-of-fact
comments of a doctor upon it.</p>

<p>In order to understand the Russia of the last
few centuries, we must first of all glance at Russian
history. Under the brutal yoke of the Mongols
the Russians learned the worst extremes of
cruelty to which the vanquished in an Oriental
country must submit; for, their country laid waste
by civil war and devastated by the Tartars, the
whole people were familiar with bloodshed, misery
and cruelty. A man’s children were his slaves,
whom he could sell four times, and his wife and
family lay under a sterner rule of fatherhood than
ever obtained even in Rome or in Asia. Prisoners
of war had to sell themselves as slaves lest they
starve.</p>

<p>Ivan was born in 1530, son of Vassili Ivanovitch
and Helena Glinska. One of his brothers
was an imbecile, and his father was sullen, changeable,
and savagely ferocious.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>When Ivan was three years of age his father
died, and, under the regency of his mother his education
in vice began; indeed, it seems to have been
prodigious. Although Helena seems to have done
her best to protect him, he was encouraged by
courtiers to yield to every form of self-indulgent
vice that is possible to a young man. He used to
watch with delight his dogs as they fell upon prisoners
whom he had had thrown to them; and was
constantly suspicious of the Boyars, or aristocrats,
whom he suspected to have organised conspiracies
against him. It is said that they used to organise
their conspiracies either in the name of Ivan or of
his mother; and they were opposed by their natural
enemies, the trading classes. Hence it was
that Ivan conceived a violent hatred and terror of
the Boyars, and an equally foolish trust in the
merchants. He had to suffer many indignities,
and saw his favourites murdered before his eyes.
Ivan struck back, until at last he captured one
Shousky, last of the Boyars, and gleefully threw
him to the dogs from the balcony whence he had
often seen his prisoners eaten. A great fire broke
out in Moscow in 1547, when Ivan was seventeen
years old; seventeen hundred people perished in
the flames. The populace rose in fury, accusing
his grandmother and her sons of setting Moscow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
ablaze. Being a good grandson Ivan acted with
vigour; he did not try to ascertain how far the
old lady and his uncles were guilty, but incontinently
seized upon the ringleaders of the people
and put them to death as they deserved. In the
midst of the pother a monk—one Sylvester—appeared.
He seems to have been like one of those
Oriental prophets who are said to have dared to
tell the truth to kings. Bravely facing Ivan, he
foretold the future in many visions and dreams;
and warned Ivan that it was owing to his own
misdeeds that Russia was suffering such tragic
torments.</p>

<p>For some reason Ivan spared him, called together
a synod of priests and other intelligentsia
of Russia and asked for its aid in the government.
Flattered, the synod drew up rules for its
ruler; and the next ten years are pictured to us—possibly
by friends of the synod—as a veritable
<i>quinquennium Neronis</i>; though the period was
longer than Nero’s. There was good government
and outward prosperity; the army was reformed;
a new code of laws was devised; a printing press
was established; Archangel was founded; trade
with England was set afoot through the White
Sea; by victories in Livonia the frontier was
pushed towards the Baltic; fortresses against the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
Tartars were established in the Crimea; and the
Turks were driven back. In these wars Ivan IV
showed himself to be a great and able general;
a worthy predecessor of that Peter the Great who
was soon to come after him.</p>

<p>But this was too good to last. In 1552 his wife
died: Anastasia, first of the Romanoffs, the
woman, as it would now seem, who saved Russia
by protecting the Tsar from harpies. Ivan was
heart-broken. He suspected her to have been
poisoned, as every sudden death in the sixteenth
century was attributed to poison; and from a
little village near Moscow he wrote a violent letter,
accusing the Boyars both of poisoning his
Anastasia and of misgoverning Russia during his
minority. He concluded by threatening that God
called him to abandon the ungrateful people, who
were unworthy of such love as his.</p>

<p>This threw Russia into a panic. “How shall
we get on without our ruler?” they asked. “Who
will defend us against our enemies? What will
the sheep do without their shepherd?”</p>

<p>Evidently Ivan was a politician of no mean
order; he knew his Russia. Touched by the weeping
of the herd, he returned to his subjects. But
how changed an Ivan! Formerly he had been a
splendid man physically, tall, broad-shouldered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
with hawk nose and eagle eyes; a true tsar of the
dynasty of Rurik; fit leader of the great Russian
people. On his return to his loving people he
was suddenly become thin and wasted; his hair
was falling; his skin was dull; his eyes had lost
their brilliance; physical degeneration had already
set in.</p>

<p>Considering his subsequent history, it is probable
that in the fit of petulance after the death of
his beloved wife he had become infected with
syphilis, which was then at the height of its conquering
career throughout Europe. Eight days
after her death he married a Circassian woman,
who was of a rough mind, and of coarse breed;
possibly it may have been from her that he caught
his disease, for to her influence is generally attributed
his mental degeneration.</p>

<p>Such a fate often happens to a physically strong
young man who suddenly finds himself deprived
of his helpmate; and it was a wise law of the
Romans, that every Governor of a province must
be married; if for no other reason than that
a wife would protect him from the attacks of
other women who might mean him less well than
she.</p>

<p>When he was seventeen, he had proclaimed
himself “Tsar,” thus showing himself bolder than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
his predecessors, who had perforce to content
themselves with the title of “Grand-Duke.”</p>

<p>Now, in his new-found glory, with his new wife
by his side, he raised for himself a bodyguard of
6,000 men, whom he called the Opritschnitza.
These men rode through the countryside with
besoms and dogs’ skulls at their saddle-bows. The
emblems were supposed to signify that they
would sweep away and hunt down all enemies
of the Tsar.</p>

<p>But the Boyars were still to be properly punished
for their wickedness; there were a few left,
and at least the children of the infamous brood
survived and had to be brought to justice; so Ivan
rode through the land from country-house to country-house
at the head of his men, besoms, dogs’
skulls, and all, slaying and burning; a right merry
journey. Those whom he could not kill perished
in the snow, and all Russia lay in terror of Æsop’s
“King Stork.” Better had it been for Russia if
the people had left him in his self-imposed quarantine,
to recover in peace from his skin-syphilis
before it had attacked his brain. For a man
suddenly driven mad by securing absolute power,
and worried by fighting, revenge, and murder, to
rage desperately about the country instead of
treating his syphilis even by the crude methods<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
that were in vogue in the middle of the sixteenth
century, was sheer madness. To this day we find
that physical and mental rest, fresh air, and mercury,
are the standbys in the treatment of syphilis,
and quite probably it is less deadly to-day than it
was in 1550.</p>

<p>It was the custom in Russia for the Tsar, when
he wanted a wife, to collect all the most beautiful
women from whom he should make his choice;
and in 1570 he, in need of another wife, collected
no less than 2,000 girls; them he kept in captivity
for more than a year, treating them as he
would, ruthlessly and relentlessly, a symptom
truly characteristic of cerebral syphilis in a man
untroubled by restraints, moral or legal. From
these he chose another wife for himself and one
for his son, that the great name of Ivan should not
perish from the earth.</p>

<p>The shuddering remainder he bestowed on his
courtiers, or sent home.</p>

<p>Cerebral syphilis is an extraordinary thing.
Besides causing general paralysis, which is known
positively to be syphilitic, the disease acts upon
the arteries of the brain, and the symptoms that
it causes seem to depend upon the areas of the
brain that the diseased arteries supply. If the
affected area is the front of the brain in which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
intellectual faculties are supposed to be, all the
symptoms of violent mental irritation are caused.
They may begin quite early in the disease, and
may last for many years till the patient’s death;
much appears to depend upon whether the patient
has been able to live a decent and quiet life. That
in the case of Henry VIII his disease apparently
led to nothing more monstrous than cutting off
two of his wives’ heads—possibly they deserved
it—and to violent and murderous political activity,
would rather seem to show that if he had had
a chance of rest and treatment he might have been
no worse a king than many others who have won
fame and gratitude. At least he was a highly
educated man who certainly meant well at first.
Ivan from the beginning was little better than a
brute, of shocking family history and evil impulses.
In him it probably went far beyond the
stage of mere syphilitic psychasthenia.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Seven wives in all were his, so that he beat
Henry’s record by one. I suppose he showed the
same miserable story of domestic unhappiness, but
I have not been sufficiently interested to find out.
Some of his letters are still extant, and they show
all the signs of insanity, in their unwieldy length,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
their foolish cunning, their voluble avoidance of
the main point, and their inconsequence. On the
evidence of these letters alone any two doctors
to-day would “sign up” Ivan IV. To say that he
became wildly sexual would be to understate the
matter: he developed the morals of a satyr. This
is all very characteristic of syphilitic insanity,
whose victims often find its worst effects in an
utter abandonment of sexual restraint. It is almost
as if the disease, being often the result of
impurity, revenges itself on the victim by accentuating
the very incontinence which has caused it.</p>

<p>The rest of the story of Ivan the Terrible—it
is strange that history has not yet called him Ivan
the Great—is not very interesting, except for two
shocking incidents that we shall relate in their
turn. It is simply the record of a man with an
Oriental mind, maddened by syphilis, abandoning
himself to the most ruthless cruelty, experimenting
as if to plumb the depths of human wickedness.
It would be wearisome both to tell it and
to read it, with all the senseless stabbings, the
stamping on the feet of helpless menials, the red-hot
pokers, the experiments in torture, the burnings,
the infamy. Let us hold our noses and turn
to historical facts of a broader interest.</p>

<p>A man, in order to curry favour with the Tsar,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
wrote a private letter to the King of Poland accusing
the great city of Novgorod of conspiring
against its ruler. Ivan found it by a trick, possibly
with the connivance of the writer. He held
his peace, just as Henry VIII had remained silent
when he first heard of the sin of Anne Boleyn.
But, without a word to anybody, he collected an
army of 15,000 men, whom he marched towards
the doomed city, around which he erected a barricade
of stakes that no one might enter or leave
so as to escape the just punishment of an outraged
Tsar. Then, for every day throughout a period
of five weeks 500 to 1,000 of the citizens were led
into his presence and put to death in all sorts of
amusing ways; Ivan’s cleverness in devising new
ways of killing seems to have been really wonderful.
So wicked was the city that neither man,
woman, nor child was spared, until but a scanty
few remained alive. This niggardly remainder he
collected before him, and forced to pray for the
beloved Tsar. Like many syphilitic lunatics he
had long considered himself to be God.</p>

<p>Then his eldest son, Ivan, who had grown
up very like himself in character, so that people
were already looking into the future with forebodings,
took offence at what the half-witted fellow
thought to be his father’s insult to his wife,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
Helena. With a roar Ivan rushed upon his son,
striking him on the head with a heavy staff shod
with iron. Ivan the prince dropped insensible,
and died in a few days. Tsar Ivan was shocked
unutterably, did penance and for a time seemed
to regain sanity in his grief for the loss of his
bright boy. But only for a time; soon the old
monotonous régime of insensate cruelty returned.</p>

<p>1584 was a great year for Ivan. Feeling rather
unwell the brilliant idea struck him that a well-born
English girl would just suit his whim; so he
sent a special messenger to Queen Elizabeth to
select him one, also to inform her that, should his
mutinous subjects prove unruly he would honour
England by seeking therein a sanctuary. Thrice
happy England; sanctuary for so many politicians!
Well might refugees from the Austrian
troubles in 1848 seek her green fields for peace.</p>

<p>The Virgin Queen selected one of her maids of
honour, Lady Mary Hastings, for this dishonour.
The Earl of Huntingdon, Lady Mary’s father,
and Lady Mary herself, shuddered and protested
at the thought of her marriage with this dreadful
man, especially as Ivan’s seventh wife was still
alive, and he had blithely proposed to set her aside
in favour of the fair English maid, as the wretched
creature would not die, nor leave him single, nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
allow him to poison her. But for once, at least,
Elizabeth’s heart conquered her head, and she did
not press the match; it was too tragic even for the
sixteenth century, so that no English girl graced
Moscow any more than did Caliban marry
Miranda.</p>

<p>But Death was still waiting, inexorably. No
doubt Ivan had long forgotten the apparently
trifling illness from which he had suffered after
the death of his first wife, or rather soon after his
second marriage, but it had not forgotten him.
Nature never forgets and seldom forgives, as so
many doctors have said about Life.</p>

<p>A frightful portent, a comet, appeared in the
sky, and as Ivan saw its horrid tail the thought
struck him that it had come to warn him of his
death. All Russia was at once in a ferment.
Soothsayers were summoned from all the ends of
the Tsardom. No less than sixty were collected to
save the life of the Tsar, that religious lunatic,
who had thought himself to be God; but the best
they could do was to promise him that he would
not die until twelve days had elapsed. “It will
be the worse for you if your promise holds good,”
said Ivan in a fury; and with that he made up his
mind to slay the soothsayers if he should survive
the twelve days. The wife of his surviving son,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
who was to succeed him as the half-imbecile Tsar
Feodor—syphilis again!—came to comfort him in
his terrors, that this mighty Tsar should not have
to go down into the dark his hand unpressed by
any woman’s; but Ivan indecently assaulted her
and she fled in terror. To the later Ivan every
woman was less feminine than female.</p>

<p>The twelfth day dawned and Ivan prepared the
scaffold for the execution of the soothsayers. He
himself took what precautions occurred to his simple
soul, and spent most of the day on a sofa playing
draughts with one of his male favourites—surely
the most harmless and safest of joys; surely
Ivan could have done nothing better unless he had
forestalled fate by a good course of mercury
thirty years before! At last, just as Ivan was beginning
to congratulate himself that he had beaten
fate, beaten the comet and beaten the astrologers,
and was glutting himself with the anticipation of
his next merry jest, he suddenly choked, uttered a
stifled cry and fell back dead. Fate and syphilis
had won; the astrologers had predicted so accurately
that their heads were even then trembling
on their shoulders. What had happened? No
doubt his syphilis had affected the aortic valve of
his heart, as it frequently does to-day. The blood,
instead of coursing on its orderly way throughout<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
his body, had run back into his heart, which, being
overfull of blood, had stopped; and in a moment
Ivan the Terrible was dead. The people wept for
him, as being the Tsar. “Such was the Tsar,”
sobbed an admirer. “Such as he was, God made
him.”</p>

<p>I do not ask you to suppose that I have diagnosed
Ivan from any special knowledge of my
own; the facts I have enumerated are all to be
found in a book called <i>The Blot upon the Brain</i>,
by the late Dr. W. W. Ireland, a once-celebrated
alienist of Edinburgh, who, so far as I know, was
the first to suggest that Ivan IV probably suffered
from syphilis. I go further, and suggest that he
probably suffered from diffuse cerebral syphilis
and syphilis of the aortic valve, just as people do
to this day.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago I read that syphilis was unusually
widespread in Russia, and I have often
wondered since 1917 whether that long ago epidemic
can possibly have had anything to do with
recent Russian politics.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Luthers_Devil">Luther’s Devil</h2>

</div>

<p>Those people who find it difficult to suppose
that God so loves man that He occasionally
suspends the operation of the principle of the
conservation of energy in order that He may interfere
in purely human affairs on this tiny planet
will also find it difficult to believe in a personal
devil who roams the world seeking whom he
may devour and haunting people. Yet Martin
Luther, who started the movement that ultimately
led the world back to science and reason, had no
difficulty whatever in believing this nonsense, and
an infinity of other nonsense that to us nowadays
seems little short of stark staring crazydom.
Surely the poor gentleman must have been deranged,
one thinks. Not at all, for Luther had
the evidence of his own senses that he was
haunted. He heard the foul fiend whistle and
roar in his ears; the devil so gripped his heart
that Luther never knew that the next moment
might not be his last; sometimes he would cause
him to be so giddy that when quietly sitting at
work Luther was forced to fall from his stool.
What was the matter with Martin Luther?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>To begin with, most assuredly he was never
mad; at the most one could fairly say that, like
most of the great leaders of thought, Luther was
probably of the manic-depressive temperament,
with that strange mixture of apparently insane
egotism and gloomy pessimism that so marks people
of that temperament. In his famous prayer
he orders his God about in a way that one can
only compare to that of the Presbyterian divine
who cried in a moment of irritation, “Noo, Lord,
that’s fair ridic’lous.” If you read Luther’s
<i>Table-talk</i>, you will at once be struck with his
curious temperament, which could combine a certain
amount of shrewd common sense, such as you
would expect from a man of Saxon peasant stock,
with profound belief in the supernatural, a good
deal of disbelief in his fellow-man, virulent
hatred of the Pope and all his works, and a good
deal of what looks uncommonly like sheer mysticism.
<i>En passant</i> I found therein the solution of
a problem that has long puzzled me. What was
the mysterious “sin against the Holy Ghost” that
nobody seems to understand? Let Luther explain
it to us himself. Many persons have imagined
that it represented one of those sexual perversions
against which primitive races have so
often launched a fierce tabu, simply because they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
knew nothing of sexual pathology. But really,
according to Luther, it was nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>“Sins against the Holy Ghost are: first, presumption;
second, despair; third, opposition to
and condemnation of the known truth; fourth, not
to wish well but to grudge one’s brother and
neighbour the grace of God; fifth, to be hardened;
sixth, to be impenitent.”</p>

<p>The only fault one has to find with this is that
Luther does not tell us how to recognise the truth
when one sees it. What <i>is</i> the criterion of truth?
Otherwise it would seem to be a fairly good description
of a certain type of neurasthenia. Many
neurasthenics must go in mortal sin every day of
their lives, for it is well known that the devil is
particularly on the lookout for sins against the
Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>Probably Luther’s devil merely represented
symptoms due to his wretched health. There is
an excellent description of his dystrophy in Hartmann
and Grisar’s monumental <i>Life of Luther</i>,
and Dr. Cabanes went over it again from the point
of view of modern medicine; while nearly fifty
years ago Dr. W. W. Ireland of Edinburgh reviewed
it from the point of view of an alienist of
that time. But Ireland did not perceive the immense
influence of Luther’s physical ailments on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
his mental condition. How could you expect him
to, fifty years ago? From these three sources,
therefore, I draw the material for this essay. A
précis of Dr. Cabanes’ essay appeared in the <i>St.
Louis Urologic and Cutaneous Review</i> for November,
1924.</p>

<p>Those fanatic Protestants who still believe that
Luther was a meek and mild sort of monk who
was driven to revolt by the sins of the “Whore of
Babylon” should read his <i>Table-talk</i> in order that
they may learn what manner of man he really
was; and it will be surprising if they rise from it
without an insight into Luther’s character that
may possibly change their whole conception of
the Reformation. Far from being a gentle and
Christlike son of the Church, he was, so far as I
can gather from his own words, perhaps the most
frenzied theologian of that dark century of theologians.
In sheer outrageous superstition he
could outdistance even the most ignorant peasant;
his fear of the devil amounted to possession, because
he attributed to the action of the foul fiend
every single thing that he could not understand.
An hour spent in reading Luther’s <i>Table-talk</i>
gives a better insight into the mind of man during
that most terrible of all centuries than a year
spent in reading an ordinary history. The most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
reasonable excuse that we can make for him is
that he was ill during the greater part of his life,
suffering from one of the most distressing of all
ailments.</p>

<p>From about the age of thirty he suffered from
dreadful noises in the head, banging, whistling,
thumping, and crashing. These were accompanied
by terrible attacks of giddiness, which
sometimes actually caused him to fall from his
stool, and rendered work impossible. Towards
middle life he became so neurasthenic that his
mental condition became almost that of a lunatic—and
indeed the Catholics did not miss the opportunity
to say that he had actually become
mad; but probably this was but a tit for Luther’s
own tat of extraordinary theological violence, and
was certainly never true. But what is true is that
he began to suffer from pains in the region of the
heart, accompanied by a sense of dreadful oppression,
so that sometimes he thought himself to be
dying. As he grew older he became very deaf,
and his cardiac distress became still more terrible.</p>

<p>All these things were to Luther certain evidence
that his personal devil was attacking him;
it is said that once he threw a pot of ink at the
fiend, and the marks of it are still shown. All
these things can be explained easily—as Dr. Cabanes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
suggested—if we suppose that Luther was
suffering from Ménière’s disease of the labyrinth,
a disease of the inner ear that occasionally attacks
middle-aged and gouty people, and is supposed to
have added its tragedy to Dean Swift’s already
tragic life. The labyrinth is composed of the
semi-circular canals, structures which are directed
longitudinally and laterally to the axis of the
body, and assist us in maintaining our equilibrium;
if anything goes wrong in these tiny tubes
an unconquerable feeling of giddiness overwhelms
us, and it is thought that it is the washing this
way and that of the fluid in these canals that
causes the deathly feeling of giddiness in seasickness.
And the fact that Luther’s deafness steadily
increased as he grew older seems to show that
it was really caused by Ménière’s disease. In
1541 he seems to have suffered from middle-ear
disease, accompanied by dreadful earaches and
discharge from the ear; while this lasted he became
temporarily quite deaf, but all the time the
labyrinthine disorder was going on.</p>

<p>Although he never seems actually to have suffered
from gout, there seems to be no doubt that
he was of the gouty diathesis, and that uric acid
was constantly circulating in his blood, which,
added to his manic-depressive temperament,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
would undoubtedly increase his tendency to
gloom. If there can be any worse devil than
frightful noises in the head, neurasthenia and uric
acid in the blood, it would be interesting to learn
what it is. Many a man has been driven to suicide
by nothing worse. That Luther seems to have
resisted any temptation to suicide that he may
have had, speaks volumes for the strength of his
purpose.</p>

<p>Probably the pains in his heart and accompanying
fear of death represented a gigantic rise in his
blood-pressure that would naturally occur in a
man of such furious polemic zeal. And it may
be that it possibly went so far as to cause angina
pectoris. The accompanying fear of death certainly
looks like angina, for there is no disease
more frightful than angina; the patient feels as
though the very grave were yawning for him.</p>

<p>Luther seems to have ultimately become on almost
friendly terms with his devil. One night at
the castle of Wartburg he heard a dreadful noise
on the stair which woke him up—probably it represented
noises in his own ears. He got out of
bed in a rage with the insolent fiend.</p>

<p>“Is that thou, devil?” he shouted, but Satan
said not a word. Then Luther, seeing that Auld
Hornie was not to be drawn, got back into bed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
piously commended himself to the care of the Lord
Jesus Christ, and ultimately got off to sleep again.
And this is the sort of thing that went on day
and night with the Reformer. What a difference
a course of salicylates and bromides might have
made to Luther, and possibly through him to the
whole Reformation, for there can be little doubt
that Luther’s devil played a great part in spurring
him to yet more furious religious zeal. Sometimes
even he began to despair, and admitted that
it was impossible to make peace with the Pope
so long as the papacy was the papacy and Luther
was Luther. Viewed in this light, that in a sense
he was Athanasius <i>contra mundum</i>, Luther’s dictatorial
and egotistical prayer to his God becomes
almost pathetic, for he felt himself alone on the
side of God against the mighty power whom he
frankly calls anti-Christ, with hardly a soul helping
him; it may have been during those passionate
appeals to God for guidance before he made the
break that his blood-pressure began to rise, for
nothing causes the blood-pressure to rise like passionate
emotion of any kind. Perhaps forty years
later it killed him. Rising blood-pressure kills
with exceeding slowness; let excitable politicians
beware, for the same rules apply to them to-day
as applied to poor Martin Luther, who was really<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
less a man of God than a most furious politician.</p>

<p>Both Hartmann and Grisar and Dr. Cabanes
give substantially the same accounts of his sudden
death; so probably it is assured in spite of the
Catholic story that he committed suicide. For
two years a stone in the bladder had added to the
tortures of his Ménière’s disease, and on February
17th, 1546, his last seizure attacked him. While
at Eisleben he became very restless. “Here at
this little village I was baptised,” he said. “It
may be that I shall remain here.” In the evening
he felt that oppression in the chest of which he
had so often complained, so he got his attendants
to rub him down with hot flannels, and as soon
as he felt better sat down to a light supper. In
the middle of the night he awoke, feeling deadly
ill. “O my God,” he said, “I do feel so ill; I
feel as though I were dying,” and complained of
a terrible oppression in his chest. His doctors
found him bathed in a cold sweat and without
perceptible pulse. He murmured his favourite
text from St. John, “God so loved the world that
He gave his only begotten son that whosoever
believeth in him shall not perish, but shall have
life everlasting.” Then he became unconscious
and his friends shouted into his deaf ears the question
whether he remained steadfast in his faith<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
in Christ and his doctrine, to which they thought
they heard him say “Yes,” though probably he
did not hear them. At three in the morning his
breathing suddenly became audible, and after
a deep sigh he died. Probably this is a true account,
for we often see the breathing of a dying
man assume the up and down character that we
call “Cheyne-Stokes.”</p>

<p>For some extraordinary reason Messrs. Hartmann
and Grisar attributed this obvious death
from heart-failure to apoplexy. One can only
suppose that they had never seen a man die of
apoplexy; and Dr. Cabanes is undoubtedly right
when he attributes it to heart-defeat after a long
period of high blood-pressure. Probably a certain
amount of angina pectoris also entered into
the picture, which is much the same thing put
into other language.</p>

<p>But it may be that Dr. Cabanes was too materialistic
in supposing that the cause of Luther’s
high blood-pressure was drink, in spite of Melanchthon’s
explicit statement that Luther was
only a moderate drinker. Probably he was no
worse than other Germans of the time; and it
seems to be undoubtedly true that intense emotion
can permanently so put up the blood-pressure
that the patient ultimately dies even if only after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
a great many years; and surely no man ever
strained his vascular system more terribly than
Martin Luther.</p>

<p>Luther was not a nice man; but nice men do
not revolutionise the world.</p>

</div>

<p>In the gloomy procession of drink, gluttony,
and syphilis which makes up so large a part
of history—always excepting for a moment Joan
of Arc, that “one white angel of war” whom the
English and French burned because she did not
and could not ever become mature, as I have
shown in <i>Post Mortem</i>—there is at least one very
great man whom one can only pity, if my ideas
about him are correct, without the faintest trace
of censure—the author of that “foul, coarse and
abominable” book, <i>Tom Jones</i>, which has been
such a nightmare to the prude and yet shows
human nature better than most of the books which
are welcomed in country parsonages.</p>

<p>On January 1st, 1753, a young servant girl
named Betty Canning disappeared from a house
in Aldermanbury, London, where she had been
employed as a servant; she reappeared on the
29th of the month at her mother’s home, starving,
half-clad, and with a fine story of abduction and
imprisonment. She identified an old gipsy-woman
as her assailant, who, being a gipsy, old and ugly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
was promptly seized and sentenced to be hanged
after the light-hearted manner of the eighteenth
century. Though London was divided into two
camps, for and against Betty Canning, there seems
to have been no talk of a vigilance committee,
probably because the great heart of the people
was not stirred by evening newspapers about the
woes of a little servant. One of Betty’s witnesses
was a little servant girl named Virtue Hall, whose
delightful name alone should have induced credence;
and Virtue appeared before Fielding, who
was then a magistrate looking into the mystery
of Betty Canning, to support Betty’s claims for
vengeance. If the gipsy had been a man no doubt
she would have been hanged promptly; but, as
she was a woman, the psychology of those days
could not imagine why Betty should have accused
her of abduction and a certain amount of trouble
was taken to test the truth of Betty’s accusations.
As a result the gipsy was by a miracle let off, and
Betty got seven years for perjury. Nowadays it
seems quite an ordinary sort of case, where a hysterical
girl will perjure her immortal soul in order
to attract attention to herself, whatever may be
the results to others; but the real interest to us
lies in the light that it casts on the sick mind of
Fielding himself; for he actually believed Virtue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
and published a pamphlet in support of her
evidence.</p>

<p>This done, Fielding’s health began to warn him
that he must take care of himself, and he set about
curing the chronic gout which had long crippled
him. He took an ancient remedy of Galen’s,
called “the Duke of Portland’s remedy”—Fielding
was always fond of experimenting upon himself
with quack medicines—and was advised to try the
waters of Bath. Meantime he had busied himself
with dogging the footsteps of no less than five
gangs of street-robbers; and in the midst of the
turmoil there came a peremptory message from the
Duke of Newcastle to attend at Newcastle House
and discuss the depredations of yet more cutthroats.
For months he worked hard at the pursuit,
with splendid results for the peace of London,
but disastrous results upon his own health, for he
had become deeply jaundiced and “fallen away to
a shadow.” No more was to be seen that
handsome Harry Fielding who had worked so
hard for literature and civic peace; whose generosity
and goodness to the poor, outcast, and oppressed
has become proverbial; but a wasted, dropsical
man of pinched face, who could hardly leave
his chair, so crippled was he with the gout and
so heavy with the dropsy. The time had long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
gone by for Bath, if indeed it had ever existed.
The winter of 1753-4 was terribly severe and his
doctors told him that he must seek a warmer climate.
Even Bishop Berkeley’s tar-water had
failed, so things must have looked black indeed
for Fielding as he was carried laboriously on
board the ship <i>Queen of Portugal</i> for the long
voyage to Lisbon. His wife, the successor of that
beloved woman whom he has immortalised in
<i>Sophia Western</i> and <i>Amelia Booth</i>, accompanied
him to nurse him, though I am afraid the poor
lady was not much use as a nurse to a sick man
whose every movement caused him pain; the very
winds fought against him, and it was weeks before
the ship could get away from the Isle of
Wight into blue water.</p>

<p>It must have been a miserable voyage for Fielding;
he was confined to the cabin because he could
not mount the companion ladder owing to his
weakness and pain. Twice he had to be tapped
for his dropsy; the food was bad, his wife confined
to her bed with a terrible toothache that could
not be relieved because the tooth seems to have
had a peculiar root that defied all attempts at removal;
but he himself, sitting propped up in the
stuffy cabin, wrote the most delightful and uncomplaining
journal imaginable, which is quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
as brilliant as, and even more moving than, any
of his novels. It is written in Fielding’s own half-jocular,
half-satirical and wholly sympathetic
style, but is entirely free from that occasional
coarseness that has shocked even a generation that
seems to revel in the sex-neurotic and introspective
psychoanalytical novel. Better to use an occasional
naughty word than to give the impression
of being constantly possessed by unclean thoughts
of sex, which seems to be the unhappy fate of
some modern novelists.</p>

<p>Although he has given us an excellent description
of his symptoms it is difficult to reduce it
to terms of modern pathology and to name his
actual sickness. I thought at first that he must
have had cirrhosis of the liver, because it is well
known to cause severe dropsy, wasting, haggard
face, and despair. But after carefully reconsidering
the symptoms I came to the conclusion that
such an idea was untenable, for cirrhosis is not
noted for its jaundice, and moreover it is caused by
long and continuous drinking, whereas Fielding
is known to have been a reasonably abstemious
drinker. But there is an even more terrible disease
which would even better than cirrhosis exactly
suit the conditions of our problem, cancer.
If we imagine Fielding to have suffered from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
certain form of internal malignant tumour spreading
to the peritoneum, all his symptoms would
be at once explained, deep jaundice, dropsy, wasting
and frightful appearance. I am assuming that
Fielding’s form of “dropsy” was what we now
call “ascites,” that is to say, an outpouring of
serous fluid into the peritoneum. His so-called
asthma may possibly have been due to heart
trouble owing to the strain on his heart caused by
oppression from the dropsy, and his “gout” to
septic disease of his teeth, which would account
for the toothless condition which so disfigured him
towards the end of his life and prevented him
from eating the ship’s food.</p>

<p>Unlike some writers who, being possessed by
their own unconscious minds, are led into filth,
Fielding, though occasionally coarse, is never
dirty. I remember during some months, when all
the cats, dogs and roosters in the neighbourhood
combined in an assault upon sleep, and an occasional
kookooburra joined in the noise, I read
through the whole of <i>Amelia</i> and thought it one
of the most delightful books in the world; and
a rereading of it tends to confirm me in that belief.
Amelia, for all her scarred nose, is one of
the most charming women in fiction, though she
had a great deal to put up with in her husband,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
Captain Booth, and though she <i>would</i> call him
“Billy.”</p>

<p>Fielding himself was what the Americans would
call a “he-man.” He was not one of the miserable,
whining, introspective heroes of post-war
fiction; and in Tom Jones and Captain Booth he
has drawn a man as he thought a man should be,
and as good men probably are if we would stop
our ears to the howls of the old women. And
these heroes of his were probably drawn from
himself. That terrible ironic creature, Jonathan
Wild, of course represents his knowledge of the
Old Bailey; it is a grim book, and far too ironical
for most people, though it has not the sardonic
and shuddering laughter of Dean Swift and his
Struldbrugs.</p>

<p>But if he had cancer when he started on his
last voyage he must have had it coming on when
he believed Virtue’s tarradiddle, and possibly it
was because of his poor health that he believed
her. No man with a cancer beginning to gnaw
at his vitals could possibly take the trouble to
cross-examine a brazen hussy who was determined
to deceive him, and we can even understand that
chapter in <i>Amelia</i> when he stops the narrative to
deliver a violent attack upon the medical profession,
possibly because when he was writing <i>Amelia</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
he must occasionally have felt the slight twinge
and noticed the slight jaundice that would be the
first symptom that all was not well.</p>

<p>But he was a very kind man, even as a magistrate.
He knew too much about human nature to
be harsh with anybody, and possibly Virtue, in
telling untruths, had touched a soft spot in his
generous heart; in other words, Virtue and Betty
must have “vamped” him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="King_James_I">King James I</h2>

</div>

<p>It would be easier to say what was not the
matter with this walking pathological museum
than to name his actual disease. From
early youth till death his life was one long pain.
He could hardly walk until he was nearly six
years old, and this defect was attributed by his
physician, Sir Theodore Mayerne, to the bad milk
of a drunken wet-nurse. Mayerne,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> who left a
full account of James’s health, seems to have
been an acute man, but nowadays we should
rather attribute the somewhat neurotic troubles
from which James suffered to his unconscious infantile
disgust at the drunken woman than to the
influence of her bad milk.</p>

<p>He himself certainly did not use milk as his
drink when he came to years of “discretion.” He
was afflicted with the normal gigantic appetite
of kings in those days. He ate anything and
everything so long as it could be eaten: not even
Charles V could have excelled his prowess. He
drank, indiscriminately, beer, spirits, Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
wines, cider, sweet French wines, and muscatel,
probably mixing them all right royally. His interior
organs were always too full, and he got
rid of the vast surplus in whatever disgusting way,
up or down, happened to be convenient, so, in
every way, he must have been a most unpleasant
companion.</p>

<p>He was subject to catarrh, and was much
affected by cold and damp; he was constantly
spitting, hawking, and blowing his nose. As
handkerchiefs were not then in general use, I have
heard that he used his sleeve or his finger and
thumb, which would not add to his “clubability.”
He had some difficulty in swallowing, owing, as
Sir Theodore puts it, to some narrowing of his
fauces, inherited from his mother, Mary Queen
of Scots, and from his grandfather, James V of
Scotland. Putting two and two together, the constant
blowing of his nose and the “narrowing” of
his throat, one imagines that probably the poor
man suffered from adenoids and enlarged tonsils.
He occasionally suffered from gravel, often accompanied
by blood. He constantly suffered from
another ignoble trouble, which in the course of
years bled copiously. If he was specially worried
in mind or body—and a king is always worried—he
would become jaundiced. Whenever anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
more than usually alarming occurred, the unhappy
man would get diarrhœa, just like an anxious
student awaiting his interview with the examiners.
He used faithfully to insist on his being bled
every day, until his least dignified ailment saved
the doctors the trouble. When he dismissed his
Parliament of 1610 apparently his diarrhœa became
profuse. In fact, if you can think of any
ailment that I have not mentioned from which he
suffered—so be it that it was excessively undignified—I
wish you would tell me what it was.</p>

<p>He had a truly psychasthenic dread of pain,
yet hated all doctors, possibly because he had
suffered too much at our hands. His teeth were
all decayed, so that he could chew nothing, but
had perforce to bolt his food. A man with the
decayed teeth that so distinguished the “most
learned fool in Christendom” would naturally in
time suffer from arthritis; and in middle age this
complaint so crippled him that he could hardly
mount his horse. He detested purgatives, and
considered that any medicine, to do good, must
act upon the bowels without griping the patient;
till late in his life he would not even allow an
enema, probably because it hurt him.</p>

<p>With death came, as usual, a little of that
dignity that was so sadly lacking in his life. S.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
R. Gardiner says that he died of a fever, but it
is impossible even to guess at its nature. Early
in the morning of March 27th, 1625, he was so
ill that he had to send for his son Prince Charles,
who came running into the king’s room in a nightshirt.
Seeing his son, King James tried to raise
himself on his pillows and to say something; but
his voice had become so weak as to be inaudible,
so that even then he failed. He was understood
to say “Veni, Domine Jesu,” and soon his breathing
ceased; in fact, like most people, he passed
painlessly into the sleep that knows no waking.
He had done with all his pain and constant discomfort,
and, so far as he knew, with the misunderstanding
that afflicted him in his life in England
and has certainly afflicted his memory ever
since. Poor James did not have a chance from
his infancy. It has been said that he failed because
he did not understand the English people;
but how could you expect him to do that when
he was constantly worried by the most distressing
and undignified of all ailments? And was it not
also equally their duty to try to understand him?</p>

<p>They held a post-mortem examination upon
him, because there were the usual accusations of
poisoning, apparently founded largely upon the
swelling of his tongue. They found that his heart<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
was enormously enlarged, and that in his left
kidney, which was greatly shrunken, there reposed
two stones, from which doubtless had come that
gravel which had so afflicted him during his life.
Possibly his enlarged heart and swollen tongue, together
with his vast overeating and drinking, may
have meant that King James I had chronic
Bright’s disease.</p>

<p>How far the drunken wet-nurse may have influenced
his later life no one can say; but it is
quite possible that the unconscious infant may
have felt a disgust that went far to cause that
nervousness and lack of dignity of which his
subjects complained. But how could any man
be dignified when he was suffering constantly from
gravel and the other tormenting, itching, weakening,
and ignoble trouble?</p>

<p>But surely we have omitted the most important
point in James’s supposed character: the unnatural
offences of which he was suspected. Well,
Sir Theodore Mayerne, who has told us so frankly
all about his hawking and spitting, his diarrhœa,
his gravel, his stones, and his bleeding hæmorrhoids,
does not seem to know anything about the
unnatural offences. The pure mind always seems
to turn towards this sort of offence when it thinks
of its neighbour. In 1642, according to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
<i>American Mercury</i> of April, 1924, the Puritans,
hardly settled down in the American colonies, were
already accusing each other of the most awful
sexual offences. And before convicting James of
such offences one would prefer the evidence of a
level-headed doctor to that of all the seventeenth-century
Puritans in the world.</p>

<p>It is strange how minds, under the influence of
fierce religious fervour, always turn, and always
have turned, to unnatural sexual offences. It is
not a product of patristic Christianity, as so many
have thought. On reading <i>The Golden Ass</i>, of
Apuleius, one must be struck with the amazing
moral filth of the Roman Empire. After wading
through hundreds of pages of gay and libidinous
dirt, one suddenly finds that one is assisting in religious
propaganda. Apuleius paints his fellow-countrymen
and women in such black colours
simply because he wants them to join in the worship
of the Great Mother, which was then so
formidable a rival to Christianity in the Roman
Empire.</p>

<p>So, considering the known facts of religious
propaganda, I do not believe a single word of the
slanders upon James I. There were Puritans
about.</p>

<p>It is possible that Petronius, in his <i>Satyricon</i>—if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
he wrote it—drew a truthful picture of the
Empire under Nero, because he does not profess
to moralise or to convert anybody whatever to
any supposed better religion. One is sometimes
inclined to agree with Gibbon that “all (<i>organised</i>)
religions are equally false and equally
useful.”</p>

<p>But it would be absurd to suppose that James
the Sixth and First was merely the ridiculous
creature that I have depicted here. Those who
wish to prove that he was a coward have first to
account for the known fact that, until his knees
stiffened under the influence of his decayed teeth,
he was a brave and first-class horseman. It may
be true that he could never bear the sight of a
drawn sword; neither could Lord Roberts bear
the sight of a cat. Before he was dragged to
England he did for Scotland what the heavy-handed
Tudors did for South Britain. By his
skill and diplomacy he welded even fierce little
Scotland into an orderly country, and taught the
Scots lords and the ministers of the General Assembly
that the king was their master.</p>

</div>

<p>Doctors seldom take much interest in
politics. It is their general experience that
for all the tumult and the shoutings of politicians
nobody ever seems one penny the better for the
uproar, for vast sums are wasted which would
be much better expended in a way that we really
do know something about, such as the cure of disease
and the public health generally. In some
ways the most interesting thing about the “Martyred
Monarch” is the expression of wistful melancholy
which is shown on the famous portrait
by Van Dyck. It is undoubtedly due to this portrait
that so much sympathy has always been felt
for him; and the tragedy of King Charles has always
impressed thoughtful men as a tragedy from
the Greek.</p>

<p>In his early youth he stammered so badly that
until he was ten he could hardly speak at all.
Stammering is supposed to be a nervous habit
due to a psychasthenic phobia; and the worst case
of stammering that I ever knew was said to have
been acquired by a nervous child of three, owing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
to a negligent nurse having locked him up in a
dark cupboard while she read novels. Stammerers
often express themselves by their pen; and several
eminent writers, both in the past and in the
present day, have been stammerers. Not less
acute than other men—indeed often far more
acute than the average—yet as they are invariably
shy they are incapable of showing it in conversation;
and the brutal outburst of Carlyle
concerning poor Charles Lamb reflects an opinion
that is too often held by the impatient and
intolerant.</p>

<p>King Charles had during his day the finest collection
of art-treasures in Europe; and in that
fact we see the essentially refined and artistic
character of the man, for he not only had the
treasures, but understood them. Stammering
often tends to improve as the man grows older.
Demosthenes is said to have cured himself by
shouting at the sea waves, while King Charles succeeded
to a large extent by speaking with extraordinary
slowness and dignity, though to some extent
the habit remained with him to the end.
Strangely enough the sad and pathetic expression
on Van Dyck’s portrait is not unlike the sad and
pathetic expression on the famous portrait statue
of Demosthenes by Polyeuctes; although of course<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
Demosthenes was of a much more aggressive character
and more ready to make himself felt in
public than Charles Stuart.</p>

<p>But in Van Dyck’s portrait we see probably the
unconscious infantile fear in the baby Charles
that ultimately led him to stammer; and possibly
in the utterly wrong-headed obstinacy of the king
in holding on to an impossible position, we see the
determination that resulted in his curing himself
sufficiently to attain the crown.</p>

<p>An incident occurred during his trial that may
have led to a false impression. “They will not
suffer me to speak,” he cried brokenly as they
led him away. Is it possible that during that
dreadful moment the old bad habit of his childish
days returned, so that King Charles actually <i>could</i>
not speak for the time?</p>

<p>He is said to have been one of the few kings
of really noble domestic character, a faithful husband
and affectionate father. Yet though he
could be faithful to his wife he could not help
telling lies to his friends.</p>

<p>Charles was temperate, chaste and serious; he
treated those about him with punctilious courtesy
and expected the same in return.</p>

<p>But it may be that in the twistings and turnings
of his political career we see the qualities
that are not inconsistent with the artistic temperament.</p>

<p>As for the apparent cause of Charles’s stammering,
that is quite impossible even to guess. It is
possible that he, a naturally sensitive and refined
little boy, may have been unconsciously terrified
by his father’s unpleasant personal habits. At
any rate, let us keep a soft spot in our hearts
for the ill-fated king.</p>

<p>Whence came the somewhat nervous strain that
runs, like a brass thread, through the whole
dynasty of the Stuarts, I hesitate to speculate:
perhaps from Darnley, father of James I. They
always make me think of a set of naughty children
wedged between the great gloomy Tudors and the
unpleasant Hanoverians. There was James I,
who is generally held by the English to have
been an egregious person; next, Charles I, who,
probably, would have done better as a poet; then
Charles II, who was by far the cleverest of them,
but was too lazy; and lastly the gloomy and exceedingly
immoral—if all tales are true—James<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
II, who was a man too much under the influence
of religion. It is said that he used to get absolution
after every time that he visited his mistress.
Then there was that poor, lonely, stupid Anne,
who could not, for some reason, rear a single one
of her numerous children.</p>

</div>

<p>As the best thing that we hear of the life of
King Charles II is the manner of his leaving
it, I confine myself to a description of his
death. You will get a moderately good account
of it in Bishop Burnet’s history, of which Swift
was so scornful; and a recognisable account of
it in Lord Macaulay, written with all the fixed
ideas of the early nineteenth century colouring the
ink; but the real truth appeared in an article in
the <i>British Medical Journal</i> for 1910, which again
was drawn largely from Dr. Raymond Crawfurd’s
<i>Last Days of Charles II</i>. As Dr. Crawfurd gives
the official report of Sir Charles Scarburgh, one
of the consultants in attendance at the time, probably
we may take it that we have the exact details
so far as the medical science of 1685 could give
them.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1684 the king did not
feel quite well: he was irritable and depressed,
and thought it wise to remain indoors during the
mornings, instead of taking his usual active walks.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
He attributed his illness to gout. It would be
interesting to speculate on what the disease actually
was that so often was called “gout” in the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. There are
many conditions which cause symptoms such as
might be mistaken for gout; let us leave it at
that, for even to-day a doctor, forced to give to a
vague complaint a name, sometimes takes refuge
in the euphemism “rheumatic gout.” During
these few days indoors he amused himself by playing
with mercury in his laboratory, for, as is well
known, he was of scientific bent. At last came the
fateful morning, Monday, February 2nd, 1685.
At eight o’clock the king, while being shaved,
fell back with a cry into the arms of an attendant,
Lord Aylesbury. According to Dr. Scarburgh,
“Charles, having just left his bed, was walking
about quietly in his bedchamber when he felt some
unusual disturbance in his brain, which was followed
by loss of speech and violent convulsions.”
There happened to be present at the time two of
the king’s physicians who, so as promptly to forestall
so serious a danger to “this best of kings,”
as Scarburgh has it, opened a vein in his right
arm and drew 16 ounces of blood. As a matter
of fact, this assault, though seemingly homicidal,
was probably as good a thing as could have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
done for him, though few doctors would have the
moral courage to do it to-day. His head was
closely shaved; his neck and shoulders were
blistered and scarified; emetics, purgatives and
clysters were administered, and every reputable
doctor, regardless of his religion, was summoned
to the defence. Whitehall must have presented a
lively spectacle that winter morning with all the
periwigs and silver buckles and gold-headed canes
and wise faces. In fact, they did what they could:
if they had known that the cause of the convulsions
was probably that the king’s kidneys had
“gone on strike,” they could have done little more
than endeavour to get rid of the poisons that must
have been circulating in his body by some other
effluent than by the urine. After about two hours
their efforts were crowned with success. The
king, whose face had been hideously black,—i.e.,
cyanosed—and whose eyes had been rolling this
way and that, woke up, and proceeded to give
an account of himself. The poisons had for a
time been got out of his body; but only for a
time. He said that, not feeling very well when
he awakened, he had gone to his private closet
to get some “king’s drops,” which Dr. Crawfurd
explains to have been “a volatile extract of bone
made in the king’s laboratory according to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
formula of the late Dr. Goddard, and in high
repute on the Continent.”</p>

<p>Charles was then out of immediate danger, and
during the Tuesday he remained fairly well except
for some soreness about the neck and mouth,
which was probably due to the efforts that had
had to be made to get him to swallow his medicines.
Just so to-day, a patient occasionally wakes
up from an anæsthetic with a stiff jaw after the
efforts which have had to be made to pull his
tongue forward if his breathing has given trouble
while he was unconscious. Charles complained
of great pain in his interior, which was probably
less a symptom of his illness than of the violent
purgatives that had been forced down his throat;
but to the horrified Bishop Burnet it was
“agonies.”</p>

<p>The doctors, pestered by the ministers of the
Crown to give the king’s illness a name, were
greatly perturbed, and all fourteen<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> of them
entered into many grave consultations one with
another. On the afternoon of Wednesday, February
4th, the convulsions returned, and as intermittent
fever was then especially prevalent in and
about London they said that probably His Majesty
was suffering from that complaint, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
to be sure the violent convulsions, cyanosed skin,
loss of speech, and turning of the eyeballs did not
look quite like intermittent fever. But the council
was satisfied, which, to the doctors wrestling
with a mysterious and complex disease, was probably
all that they could expect, for it enabled
them to say that they now knew what to do, and
that, apparently, the king was in no great immediate
danger. As the <i>British Medical Journal</i>
rather unkindly points out: “On June 21st, 1902,
the late King Edward’s Private Secretary wrote
that there was not a word of truth in the rumours
that had been floating about concerning His
Majesty’s health, though on June 24th the coronation
was postponed and he had to be operated
on for appendicitis”; though, considering what a
sudden thing acute appendicitis is, there is little
wonder that three days before anyone might not
have known of his coming ill health.</p>

<p>On the Thursday occurred those dramatic
events of which conventional historians have made
so much. When he was first taken ill on the Monday
his poor wife had hurried to his side, and
had taken the place of at least one of his mistresses
in nursing him. Catherine of Braganza may not
have had sufficient physical charm to keep his wayward
fancy, and may not have been able to bear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
him an heir,<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> but at least she was faithful to him
unto his death. In her presence the other women
retired, and she nursed her husband until the horrors
of the sick room overcame her; she felt faint
and withdrew; as Macaulay says, “was carried
senseless to her chamber.” Little wonder; the
sick room must indeed have been horrible to every
sense, with all the purgatives and clysters and cauterization
of bare skin, and a husband writhing in
convulsions and rolling his eyes, apparently in the
utmost agony, though I doubt if he felt anything
at all in his fits. Early in her married life she
had fainted when Charles had introduced her to
his mistress <i>en titre</i>. There had been many occasions
for fainting since then, and she had been
accused of trying to poison Charles, who had
humiliated her. Later on she sent word to him
that she asked his pardon for being too ill to come
to his aid; and Charles said, “She ask my pardon,
poor woman! I ask hers, with all my heart.” Yet
the time was to come when she was accused of
inducing him to turn Roman Catholic. Macaulay
seems rather to blame the Duchess of Portsmouth
for seeing that he was “reconciled” to the Church,
as she would doubtless put it, but there is another<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
suggestion that occurs to myself. With all his
laziness and clever frivolity, Charles was, after all,
very much like other men; he had had a mother,
and Queen Henrietta Maria, though a daughter
of Henri Quatre, was an ardent Roman Catholic;
during the first few years of her married life with
King Charles I she had undergone a great deal of
hardship for her religion. She must have frequently,
like other mothers, talked over religious
matters with her children; and when Charles II
came to die, when his courage and self-esteem
were weakened by the crowning humiliation of
death, it is quite possible that in that awful moment
he may have sincerely turned to Mother
Church, that Church which had consoled his
mother, as a refuge. And hence doubtless arose
that dramatic interlude in the act of dying that
Macaulay paints so vividly. The Duchess of
Portsmouth may have wept and poured out her
heart to the French Ambassador as he says; no
doubt the Benedictine monk, John Huddlestone,
was summoned just as he says; but after all, it
is the penitent himself who had to do penance,
and quite possibly Charles, in trying to swallow
the holy bread, was really unconsciously remembering
the teachings of his Roman Catholic
mother. We have seen how Elizabeth, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
dying, recalled to her memory events of her youth;
why should we not think just the same of Charles
II? He was not mad as Protestants said; he was
just dying. It is quite a common incident with the
dying, and is supposed to account for the known
phenomenon that rationalists, when they feel their
brain is beginning to betray them, have embraced
Christianity. Then he commended the Duchess
to the care of his brother, the Duke of York, afterwards
James II, “and,” he said, “let not poor
Nelly starve.” Again he was thinking of the past,
this time the recent past, for “pretty witty Nell”
(as Pepys calls her), “the most indiscreet and the
wildest creature that ever was in a court” (as
Burnet calls her), had been his mistress for many
years—since about 1670—and was the most popular
of all, “a true child of the London streets.”
She, it is said, was the only woman who was really
faithful to him at heart except his wife. At half-past
ten on the Friday, Charles again became
speechless; before twelve he was dead, probably
of a uræmic coma due to chronic Bright’s disease.</p>

<p>Then came the inevitable accusations of poisoning
which attended every sudden death in that
suspicious age. We can, I believe, even explain
some of the symptoms that were considered so
suspicious. It was quite natural that Louise de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
Querouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth, should be
accused of poisoning him, for it was well known
at that time that Frenchwomen and Roman Catholics
invariably worked by poison, and unhappily
for Louise she was both. But what kind of poison
could cause blue spots to form upon a man’s chest?
And what kind of poison could make his tongue
swell up? I must try to explain in popular language
what chronic Bright’s disease really is. It
is not merely a disease of the kidneys. The kidneys
indeed become sclerosed, or hardened, and in
time become shrivelled; but with this the arteries
and heart also become diseased; the heart becomes
enlarged, and the blood-vessels thickened and
hardened; rather than a disease of the kidneys
alone it is almost a thickening of the arteries all
over the body, including those in the kidneys.
And with this thickening goes a loss of elasticity,
so that blood-vessels are apt to rupture at the
slightest provocation. So that in the struggles
of his uræmic convulsions it is quite possible that
tiny capillaries of the king’s chest may have ruptured
and caused blue spots on the neighbouring
skin. If he had not died it is quite probable that
the whites of his eyes might have become bloodshot,
from the rupture of some tiny arteriole. It
often happens to-day in Bright’s disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>And the tongue? Quite frequently the tongue
and larynx suddenly swell up in chronic Bright’s
disease, and the patient suffocates before he can
obtain relief. King Charles was indeed poisoned,
though not by human agency. He was poisoned
by the toxins which should have been excreted by
his own kidneys, but could not be got rid of by any
human aid; that is to say, he probably died of
uræmia from chronic Bright’s disease.</p>

<p>A post-mortem examination was held, so we can
get even further evidence. One could not expect
a doctor in the seventeenth century to observe that
his kidneys were obviously diseased, or that part
of his brain was œdematous or softened, as often
happens in Bright’s disease, and would no doubt
cause the loss of speech. But they did observe
that his heart was enlarged, a most significant
point.</p>

<p>I remember one of the very first private patients
that I ever had, nearly thirty years ago. A middle-aged
Englishman had come to Sydney from China
for his health, apparently feeling fairly well,
though debilitated by the tropical climate. Suddenly,
as he was shaving, he was taken ill with a
violent fit of convulsions, and, in spite of all that
we could do for him, died in the course of two
or three days with symptoms that exactly resembled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
those so graphically portrayed by Lord
Macaulay and Dr. Crawfurd.</p>

<p>There is much of extraordinary interest to be
found in Dr. Crawfurd’s book which gives the
fantastic truth about medicine in 1685,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> I can
only advise you to read the book. In spite of the
queer medicines that they used to prescribe I fancy
that doctors at that time had more common sense
than we moderns seem to think, and I very much
doubt if anything could have saved King Charles’s
life, except perhaps for a short time. He had
come to his end. Our treatment would have been
less drastic, but little more successful.</p>

<p>The cause of chronic Bright’s disease is not
definitely known. It has been attributed to innumerable
things; indeed, to everything which
any given physician does not like himself; and
comparatively recently it has even been attributed
to improper feeding in infancy, so far back in life
are its roots supposed to go. Indeed, it is generally
thought to be hereditary; but probably it is
still a mystery, though overeating and overdrinking
may have something to do with it, not to
mention, of course, syphilis, but so many men
who have not had syphilis die of chronic Bright’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
disease that it would not be fair to state it as
the cause.</p>

<p>But why is it that Henri Quatre, whose morals
were little if at all better than those of Charles,
has become a national hero, while Charles is always
held up as a byword for infamy? I do not
know; but the usual explanation is that the English
are at heart Puritans, and M. Chevrillon, in
his recent essays on English literature, has accepted
that as the reason for the popularity of
Kipling and Galsworthy. But I sometimes wonder
whether, had England been more successful
under Charles II, so much would have been heard
of his immorality. After all, Lord Nelson was
not a Joseph, but he saved England from Napoleon;
whereas Charles II saw the Dutch fleet
in the Thames, and ran about chasing butterflies
while the guns thundered.</p>

<p>All medical students, and most doctors, pass
through a period when they are convinced that
they have chronic Bright’s disease, and it is not
till after visiting their physicians in an agony
of mind that they are relieved of their mental
distress. Let not a lay reader be silly enough to
copy these apprehensive doctors. No man can
be his own physician.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most interesting things about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
Charles II are the sterility of his wife, Catherine
of Braganza, and his affection for “poor Nelly,”
which she undoubtedly returned. Catherine appears
to have been a convent-bred maiden with
beautiful eyes. She was by no means the king’s
first or last love; and several months after the
marriage she fell ill of some sickness that brought
her to death’s door, so that they had to administer
extreme unction. It was probably owing to this
illness that she never had a child, and was afterwards
often ill. Such a trouble as pelvic peritonitis,
with inflammation of the Fallopian tubes,
often causes sterility. It is Nature’s stupid way
of saving the patient’s life that she isolates the
inflammation and seals the tubes, so that the
woman indeed lives, but miserable, sterile, neurasthenic,
and in constant pain. What was the
actual cause of the illness in Catherine’s case it is
impossible to say. One ventures to hazard a guess
that the real cause of Catherine’s sterility was
simply adhesions and blocked Fallopian tubes; it
is certain that it had nothing to do with King
Charles’s potency, because he had many natural
children by other women. It is in that severe illness
several months after she was married that
the explanation of her sterility probably lies. We
see innumerable cases of this sort to-day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>About Nell Gwynn. She was herself the
daughter of a prostitute who, in a fit of drink, one
night fell into a ditch and was drowned. Her
charm over the king probably lay in her wit and
recklessness; she dared to say to him things that no
one else on earth ventured. She was faithful to
him after he had won her—if indeed she took
much winning. Other women, such as La Belle
Stuart, and Louise de Querouaille, pretended to
resist him for a time, but Nell seems to have been
really fond of him and did not resist at all. Remember
she was, before she became an actress, an
orange-girl—that is to say, a prostitute. Everything
we hear of her tells of her uniform kindness
and generosity; she was of course extremely loose
in her conduct and morals, but she seems to have
cared little for money. She died about two years
after the king, apparently of a stroke that had
brought on one-sided paralysis or hemiplegia; and
considering the assured facts of her youth, and the
early age at which she died, that stroke was probably
caused by syphilis, which had lain latent in
her ever since the time when she sold herself with
her oranges in the pit of Drury Lane.</p>

<p>But no person should attempt to describe the
life either of Charles II or Nell Gwynn who has
the slightest tendency to moralise; for neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
the wittiest of the Stuarts nor the clever little
actress can be explained on conventional codes of
morality. It is the attempt to consider Charles II
as if he had been a child of Queen Victoria, and
to moralise over him, that makes most books about
him so repulsive.</p>

<p>But Nell did not try to enter politics; she resisted
the temptation to be queen, even if the opportunity
had ever offered. She knew that her
only function in life was to charm; and with the
coldly realistic outlook on life that is common to
all prostitutes, she knew that in the position of a
queen she must come up against the harsh facts
of reality, and that, like Anne Boleyn, she would
probably lose her head in every sense of the
word. Mere power to charm is not for a queen.
Nell’s memory, owing to her wisdom and self-restraint,
has been tenderly treated by the English
people, in spite of that prudery which has scoffed
at the real cleverness of her royal lover. Nell
Gwynn, to use her own coarse words, was content
to remain “the Protestant whore,” the cleverness
of her tongue enabled her to keep her place
at Court against all rivals, and her charm even
impresses us to-day, who have never seen her
dance nor heard her cockney witticisms. “Let
not poor Nelly” fade from our memories.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Henri_Quatre">Henri Quatre</h2>

</div>

<p>The great thing about Henri Quatre, from
the point of view of a medical essayist, is
that no person of an anti-syphilitic fury will expect
him to be classed as an awful warning of the
devastations of that disease. Poor Henri died
of good honest assassination, the product of an
even worse disease than syphilis—sectarian intolerance.
A disease which could cause the awful
wars of Henri’s own life, and a few years later
the most dreadful of all wars—the Thirty Years’—need
not fear to be classed alongside even the
most disreputable and destructive of human disorders.
And the fact that nobody in these terrible
wars ever had the least idea why people were killing
each other only makes the marvel of sectarian
intolerance even more amazing than it is. Of
course, there is no such thing as <i>religious</i> intolerance.
Religion should make war impossible, and
should inculcate tolerance for other people’s opinions.
Did the good-natured and kindly gods of old
Greece ever breed a religious war? Did anybody
ever go swashbuckling in helmet and armour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
for Zeus or Aphrodite? Unless perhaps Aphrodite
to him meant some individual woman who
had been raped from her home, such as Helen
of Troy; and Helen probably meant some vague
abstraction of a Greek woman as opposed to
a barbarian, if she did not symbolise Greek trade
through the Hellespont, obstructed by Trojan robber
bands. The Marxian materialist view of history
grows rather attractive when it is applied
to people who have been dead three thousand
years.</p>

<p>Quite apart from the murderous sectarian
squabbles, which have been dignified by the name
of religious wars, the life of Henri Quatre, very
properly classed as one of the heroes of France,
is extraordinarily interesting to a doctor. But
in many ways the most interesting thing about
him was his relations with women. Henri may
have had some conscience about religion—though
I doubt it—but, like our own Charles II, he had
absolutely no conscience about women. To him,
whether he was married or not, any pretty girl
was fair game; and those who care to read pornography
can find plenty of it in the record of
his life. The seventeenth century was a period
of bitter sectarian differences, and it was a time
when the divine right of kings to possess pretty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
girls was elevated almost to an article of faith.
Thus we had the marvellous spectacles of King
Henri IV and King Charles II, of whom the one
became a national hero, the other a byword for
flippancy and falsehood. I am not going to be
led into any temptation to find the cause of the
one phenomenon in the other—to say that if it
had not been a period of such bitter sectarianism
the virtue of girls might have been more sacred
to kings, because there have been good kings and
bad kings at all times; girls have been virtuous
or wanton, whatever their religion; and the seventeenth
century was not the only century in history.
The sixteenth and eighteenth could show
instances of moral depravity quite as bad as that
of either Henri Quatre or Charles Stuart. Let us
see what a doctor may be able to say about Henri
Quatre.</p>

<p>When he was about nineteen he married Marguerite
de Valois, the third of that name, who
has achieved fame under the popular name of
Reine Margot. She was sister to King Henri III
of France; our Henri was at that time only king
of Navarre; his little kingdom lay in the south
of France, near the borders of Spain. His father
had been Anthony of Bourbon; his mother Joan
of Albret. Joan had agreed to the marriage with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
very heavy heart: she feared the bright eyes of the
Catholic enchantress who was to bewitch her own
beloved son. She herself was a Huguenot, who
looked upon Marguerite as sent directly from the
devil. If Marguerite had really been sent by
Satan to the inferno of Parisian wickedness she
needed no great ensnaring; for, when she married
the good Henri of Navarre, simple young country
bumpkin that he was, she is said to have already
had an affair with the Duke of Guise, and her
reputation for virtue would not have passed any
great test. She was pretty, and what was more
potent, she had a peculiar charm of manner that
enabled her to capture all but the most resistant
of men. Many of us remember how Marguerite,
in the “Huguenots” of Meyerbeer, dances along
the stage singing to her lute and plangent orchestral
pizzicati “The fair land of Touraine.” Although
this, according to Wagner, is very inartistic,
still, it is very charming, and has no doubt
left Marguerite for us moderns with a character
that is more beautiful than it really was. She
could no more resist enchanting a man than Henri
could resist trying to possess a good-looking girl:
the bonds of matrimony sat very lightly upon
both. There was no love in the marriage, which
was, almost more cynically than most royal marriages,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
simply an affair of State. Catherine de
Medici, Marguerite’s mother, wished to convert
Henri to the Catholic faith, and at the same time
to make him an enemy of Spain, which, under
Don John of Austria, had just won the earth-shaking
victory of Lepanto.</p>

<p>But Marguerite could do something else besides
make love: she could write. At a time when
every one else was striving to be distinguished in
style Marguerite wrote as simply and clearly as
if she were speaking; and her <i>Memories</i> are therefore
still delightful to read. Just after her marriage
the massacre of St. Bartholomew broke out.
Let the royal lady tell how it affected herself.
“An hour later, while I was fast asleep, someone
came beating at my door with hands and feet,
and shouting Navarre, Navarre! My nurse,
thinking it was my husband, ran to open the
door. It was a gentleman, wounded by a sword-thrust
in the elbow, and his arm cut by a halberd,
who rushed into my room pursued by four archers.
Seeking safety he threw himself on my bed. Feeling
this man clutching me I threw myself into the
open space between the bed and the wall, where,
he still grasping me, we both rolled over, both
screaming and both equally frightened. Fortunately
the Captain of my Guards, M. de Nancay,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
came by, and seeing me in such a plight could
not help laughing, but drove the archers out of
the room, and gave me the life of the poor gentleman,
who was still clinging to me, and whom I
caused to be tended in my dressing-room till he
was quite cured. While I changed my nightdress,”—Marguerite
was lucky to be wearing one
in 1572—“for he had covered me with his blood,
M. de Nancay told me what had happened, and
assured me that my husband was in the king’s
room and was quite safe. Making me throw on a
dressing-gown, he led me to the room of my sister,
Madame de Lorraine, which I reached more dead
than alive; just as I was going into the anteroom
a gentleman, trying to escape from the archers
who were pursuing him, fell dead three paces from
me. I too fell half-fainting into the arms of M.
de Nancay, and felt as if the same blow had
pierced us both.”</p>

<p>Dumas describes this incident in <i>Marguerite de
Valois</i>; but his description is no more vivid than
Marguerite’s. The temptation to make the poor
fugitive the hero of his book was too great, and
he turned the ill-fated De la Mole into Marguerite’s
unwilling bedfellow on that night of
weeping. I dare say that Marguerite was not
sorry to be able to save the poor man’s life, even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
though Dumas makes her behave far from generously
to his hero later. If I remember rightly
she has him tortured by the “boot.”</p>

<p>Queen Joan, her mother-in-law, describes her
as being very pretty, but one could not see her
face for the paint; she was rather too stout, and
was tightly laced. Afterwards, when she had
abandoned all sense of decency, she became
enormously fat, and could hardly get through an
ordinary door. Her intelligence and great fondness
for reading probably did not make Henri
love her any better, because he could never finish
a serious book. She said about her brother Henri
III that if all the treachery in the world should
perish Henri III had enough to restock it; so it
is clear that brother and sister did not really
love one another; and probably Marguerite could
not resist the temptation to make a scathing
epigram.</p>

<p>But Joan need not have been so perturbed over
her son falling into the hands of the satanic
Marguerite, for, if all tales were true, she was
no great saint herself. Once, when Henri III
was in a particularly bad temper, he went to
Marguerite in church and called her all manner
of abominable names, so that she turned and ran
weeping out of the church. Later he went up to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
Henri Quatre and half-apologised for his rudeness,
explaining it because of some unfortunate
incidents that had been rumoured about Queen
Joan’s own virtue. Henri laughed, and afterwards
said, “What a nice fellow he must be! He
thinks by saying that I am a bastard to make up
for calling my wife a prostitute!” That was
really much the sort of thing that our own beloved
Charles II might have said; and it shows
Henri Quatre as a maker of epigrams with just
sufficient truth in them to hurt. And all done
with a kindly smile, too.</p>

<p>When the civil war broke out Henri of Navarre
took the lead with furious energy on the
Protestant side; and it was then that he won
his reputation for soldiering and for romance.
The white plume of Navarre has been an oriflamme
for many a novelist ever since. And it
was more than romance, though treated romantically
by Macaulay in his <i>Battle of Ivry</i>.
Henry had bound upon his head a great plume
of white peacock feathers just before the battle.
“Should the standards fall,” he cried, “rally round
the white plume of Navarre. I promise you that
it shall be found in the thickest of the fighting.”
He made good his boast, for he charged the Catholics
two horses’ lengths ahead of his followers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
and fought furiously until his sword was beaten
out of shape and his right arm swelled with over-exertion—I
suppose the lymphatics of the arm
became somehow obstructed, but I confess I do
not quite understand the pathological condition;
still, the incident made a great impression upon
his soldiers and gave Henri of Navarre a name
for immense courage and enterprise. As a result
of many hours’ fierce fighting the Protestants
swept the field, partly because the Swiss mercenaries,
finding that the League had not paid their
wages, surrendered incontinently. “Pas d’argent—pas
de Suisse,” was their excellent motto, which
the League should have remembered. If Henri
had swept on to Paris the opinion is that he
might have entered it with very little trouble.
But he had no money, he had fired away all his
ammunition, and the roads were made impassable
by recent rains; moreover, even if Paris had
opened her gates to him the Pope would never
have ceased his hostility to a Protestant king of
France; and once more the old spectre of civil
war, interminable, bloodthirsty, and dreadful,
would have arisen. And, after all, the majority
of Frenchmen were Catholic; and the mighty
power of Spain waited just over the Pyrenees to
help the Pope if indeterminate civil war should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
occur. Paris lay, weakly defended, ready for
assault; but it would have been a terrible crime
for Henri to give the word, and to subject his
capital to a worse than St. Bartholomew. So he
agreed to “receive instruction,” saying before he
did so that his religion was that of all brave men.
Paris, strictly invested, suffered the worst horrors
of famine. Soldiers killed and ate stray children,
and a woman even salted down and ate her own
babies who had died of starvation. It is said
that the poor creature went “melancholy” from
this Thyestian feast, and who can wonder? The
great Alexander Farnese, Prince of Parma, was
arriving from the Netherlands with a relieving
army of Spaniards; he outmanœuvred Henri, and
opened navigation to the beleaguered city. Henri
could neither pay his men nor would he permit
them to pay themselves by the sack of the city,
so naturally they went home. Henri and a few
faithful friends and horse soldiers retired to watch
and hope. Thus was fulfilled the prophecy of
his great, though somewhat thrifty, ally, Elizabeth
of England, that “if God shall, by His
merciful grace, grant you victory, I swear to you
that it will be more than your carelessness deserves.”
Kipling, in an unforgettable phrase, has
told us all about the “female of the species”;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
and in many ways, Elizabeth was the female of
the species to which Henri Quatre belonged. The
daughter of Henry VIII would have had no mercy
if her own ends had been at stake. And yet, I
don’t know. Tilly a few years afterwards showed
at Magdeburg the horrors that could be perpetrated
by religious enthusiasts; and one hates to
think that Elizabeth’s famous patriotism could
ever have allowed her to sacrifice London for a
point of belief. Henri Quatre had not only allowed
friends in Paris to be fed while he was
supposed to be investing it savagely, but he had
allowed it to slip through his fingers when he
might have captured it, all through a tender-heartedness
that would spare its citizens the horrors of
a Magdeburgian sack. It is no wonder that with
all his faults he is one of the heroes of France.
Then Parma, finding that the Parisians hated
Spanish pride more than they hated French Protestants,
went away with his invincible army;
and as soon as his back was turned Henri resumed
the siege. Parma had proved, if nothing more,
that he was a better strategist than Henri
Quatre; but Paris returned to the old misery of
starvation and disease, a misery that it has so
often braved nobly.</p>

<p>And now began Henri’s more serious troubles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
with women. For a long time he had an affair
with one Madame de Grasmont, whom he called
Corisande. To her he wrote the most passionate
of letters. Anybody would think to read them
that he really loved her; but even as he besieged
Paris he had fallen in love with the abbesses of
Poissy and Montmartre, whose profession should
have taught them wisdom if not virtue. Now
came a more serious affair. In 1590 he met a
Gabrielle d’Estrees, with whom he fell violently
in love while he was “carrying on” with the other
three ladies. She already had a beautiful lover;
but that did not matter to Henri Quatre. Probably
it only caused him to admire her the more.
He slipped through detachments of the enemy
dressed as a woodcutter with a bundle of straw
on his head to visit her: a nice romantic and undignified
action for a king; but we shall see later,
as he grew older, how he could stoop even lower.
For the present the problem was how to gain possession
of Gabrielle, get rid of Corisande, and
set up a nominal possessor who should not be a
rival in Gabrielle’s heart. He got her father to
marry Gabrielle to a M. de Liancourt, an aged
widower with eleven children, while Henri IV
enjoyed the <i>droits de seigneur</i>. Corisande, growing
old, dropped out of the picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>Then came a fierce struggle for Rouen, with
Parma hovering ready to give battle. Again he
showed his superiority to Henri Quatre as a strategist
by transporting his army secretly across the
Seine and escaping Henri’s threatened attack.
Henri had a much larger army than Parma’s,
and it was only Parma’s extraordinary skill that
saved him from destruction. But now came the
end of the long war; for Parma died and Henri
turned Catholic. “Paris is well worth a Mass!”
as he did not say. We have always been taught
to consider this as an act of shameless cynicism;
but there was a great deal to be said in Henri’s
favour: certainly from the point of view of the
twentieth century his action was the only thing
that could have brought peace to his country.
Though Parma was dead, Spain was still powerful
and vengeful; the Catholic priests called Henri
heretic, relapsed miscreant, devil and bastard,
whom the soldiers knew to be a kind and generous
friend, always smiling and ready to help.
Gabrielle—“charmante Gabrielle,” who has given
her name to a song that Henri wrote in her honour—urged
him to turn Catholic, that the Pope might
perhaps divorce Marguerite and let him marry
Gabrielle. So Henri yielded, threw his scruples
to the winds, and embraced the Old Religion;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
though his embrace was probably not so ardent
as those which he gave to the abbesses, who more
corporeally represented the faith to which he
yielded.</p>

<p>An amusing sidelight on his character is thrown
by his message to Queen Elizabeth by the mouth
of her supposed lover Essex, whom she had been
rating soundly because he had lost too many
Englishmen in Henri’s wars. The irate Virgin
was so flattered by Henri’s praise of her beauty
and charm that it needed all her caution and
frugality to keep England from plunging single-handed
into yet another great war with Spain
on his behalf. Happily for us she had sense
enough to keep out of it; and before her help
became necessary Henri had gone to Mass. When
Henri fell so shamelessly in love with Gabrielle
he was thirty-five years of age, and perhaps the
ordinary neurasthenia of middle age began to
trouble him—that cause of so much marital unhappiness
and so many divorces. But, if any one
woman could be said to have captured his heart,
it was undoubtedly Gabrielle. I once read an
account of her written by a lady, possibly unmarried.
Anyhow, none would have guessed from
this extremely proper description that she was
Henri’s official mistress; the good lady seems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
never to have heard of a man being anything but
a woman’s husband. Gabrielle was rather ample
of figure—Henri seems to have liked his women
fat—and had deep blue eyes and golden hair.
Her face was kind and smiling, her manner gentle;
before she fell in love with Henri her morals
had been, to say the least, unconventional; after
she admitted the king to her friendship she continued
her relations with the lover who had innocently
introduced her to this more enterprising
king. She was extravagant, and the king loaded
her with jewels at a time when he said he was
penniless; created her Marchioness of Monceaux
and Duchess of Beaufort. He was as faithful to
her as it was possible for him to be to any woman,
which is not saying very much. At any rate his
<i>amours</i> were henceforth conducted with a certain
amount of decency and discretion. When she
died the only book found in her possession was her
“book of hours.” Except for her easy morals
it would be impossible to find a greater contrast
than that between her and Marguerite, who could
wrap herself in learned books, play the lute, and
write like a novelist. It would seem impossible
for even “Aunt Tabitha” of a lady’s newspaper
to give to Marguerite de Valois any hints on the
art of managing a husband; but it is clear that she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
did not go the right way about it with Henri of
Navarre; and Gabrielle d’Estrees was evidently
much more to his taste, for he remained approximately,
though not bigotedly, faithful to her till
she died. In justice to Marguerite it is only fair
to say that she never liked him; she was forced
by mother and brother into marrying him; and
probably even a sixteenth-century princess had
her preferences. The ultimate result was that
Gabrielle became a sort of idol among the people,
who overlooked her unusual position for the sake
of her wide-set blue eyes and kind smile; and a
few years after she died she was already a legend.
To this day she and Henri Quatre are greeted
with a kindly smile among the French when one
mentions them, and “charmante Gabrielle” is still
a well-known song.</p>

<p>As the years rolled by she bore him several
children, and more and more took the position of
his wife. He became still more infatuated with
her; and she, for her part, abandoned the life
of dissipation which is said to have distinguished
her youth. Henri wanted to marry her; she
must have had great powers of fascination to
make him so faithful after so many years. The
idea was to procure a divorce from Marguerite
and elevate his mistress to the throne. But just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
before the proposed marriage Gabrielle went to
Paris and stayed at the house of an Italian
named Zamet. On April 7th, 1599, she became
very ill, and was artificially delivered of a dead
child on the 9th. She fell into violent convulsions;
on the 10th she became unconscious, and
that evening she died. Of course Sully, who
did not like her—for even Gabrielle had her
enemies—hinted that she was poisoned—such
was the reputation of the Italians in Paris at
that time—and Sully’s ill-natured hint has evidently
influenced historians to this day, for the
good lady whom I quoted above repeats it as at
least probable. But is it not much more probable
that she died of puerperal eclampsia? She
was middle-aged; she had had several children;
she was far from slight in figure. At the Royal
Hospital for Women in Sydney we find that
most of these women who die nowadays from
eclampsia are very much like Gabrielle in age,
figure, and the number of their children. Of
course it is impossible to say definitely; but I
should be very much surprised to find that Gabrielle’s
kidneys were absolutely healthy during
that last year of her life. And it is quite possible
that in that last confinement Gabrielle in
this way paid the penalty for her dissipation in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
early youth. It is at least more likely that she
should die from a perfectly well-known and
fatal disease such as eclampsia than that anybody
should try to poison a woman so generally
popular, though she had enemies who were both
jealous of her and disliked the idea of a royal
mistress becoming Queen of France. Kidney
trouble is often caused by drink, and people at
the Court of France—indeed, all over Europe—generally
used to drink too much in those days.
After all, it is only a speculation that could
easily explain the sudden death of an apparently
perfectly healthy woman just as the moment
was approaching when she would achieve her
ambition.</p>

<p>Henri was broken-hearted; he swore that never
more could he see happiness again. Yet three
months later he was paying court to a very
different sort of woman from Gabrielle—to
Henriette d’Entragues, a slim girl of eighteen
with a bitter tongue. He was then about fifty
years of age, and had led a very anxious and
troubled life. He had been a hard rider, a
famous cavalryman. At the end of a few weeks
of “courtship” he induced Henriette to accept a
document in which he promised to marry her if
she could bear him a living son in the course of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
a year. Henriette agreed to try, and joyfully
took her position as the mistress and promised
wife of the King. But alas for Henriette! Six
months later there came a terrible thunderstorm
that caused her to miscarry, and released Henri
of his bargain. But his ministers had already
engaged him to Marie de’ Medici; and Henri
probably felt that Jove’s thunderbolt had come
to his assistance. By that time Marguerite had
been duly divorced by an obliging Pope, who
would no doubt do a great deal for the brand
plucked from the burning of Protestantism. In
middle age Marguerite became enormously fat,
and there are many stories told about her orgies
with footmen and other tall fellows. It is said
that, if they died in her service, she used to carry
their hearts about her in a bag, and that she used
to wear a wig made from their locks of yellow
hair. Indeed, imagination has exhausted itself
in devising infamies for the last years of Marguerite
de Valois. It is difficult to recognise
this corpulent and beraddled woman in the gay
young princess who danced to lute and pizzicati
strings in the “Huguenots.” Reine Margot indeed
had a sorrowful ending, judging by the
ordinary canons of human happiness. But perhaps
the stories are not true. She is always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
considered an amazing example of the Valois
faculty for combining artistic sensibility with
the grossest lust. Strange things are said to have
happened in history; and one must always remember
her very unhappy marriage.</p>

<p>Soon after fifty old age, according to Sir
Humphrey Rolleston, usually touches the average
man lightly on the shoulder, and his friends
begin indelicately to “chaff” him, saying, “Oh,
you’re not as good a man as you were ten years
ago”; it is then that the average man, according
to some philosophers, begins to feel happy for
the first time in his life. Proverbs have been
coined about this well-known fact, on the lines
of the Greek “call no man happy till he is
dead.” According to another school of philosophy
happiness only comes with the loss of
the teeth. But sometimes the aging man boasts
of his prowess as if to defy time and proverbs.
Such a hero is always abnormal: either the first
symptoms of some nervous disease are beginning
to show themselves, or some other less subtle
change is occurring in his body. His position is
very much like that of a lady who, after the
climacteric, observes that what she thinks to be
the normal periodical discharge has returned; she
does not know that this is often the first sign of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
cancer of the womb, and that what she thinks
to be rejuvenescence is really often her death-warrant.
Youth never returns; the tale of years
is inexorable. It is lucky for the old man if he
has some faithful friend who will guard him,
and, as is said euphemistically, “keep him out of
mischief”—that is to say, keep him from catching
syphilis, which is a terrible thing in old age,
or at any age. The old man thus afflicted seems
absolutely to go mad about women; dignity,
honour, decency, and all else, are forgotten.</p>

<p>When to ordinary senility there is added the
intolerable desire that accompanies such trouble
as I have mentioned, all other considerations are
cast to the winds. After his marriage to Marie
de’ Medici Henri abandoned even the pretence
of decency. Marie seems to have had to let him
go his own way. As for him, he complained
that she made his life a hell upon earth, and he
attempted to assuage his wounded feelings with
every other girl who came his way. There were
many such who yielded to the king while they
mocked at the elderly man with their younger
lovers. Then, in 1609 he met Charlotte de
Montmorency, a charming and beautiful maiden
of fifteen. He saw her while she was rehearsing
for a mask, dressed up as a nymph of Diana.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
He was passionately arrested by her beauty, but
soon afterwards was laid up with an attack of
gout. Alas, Charlotte was already engaged to
a M. de Bassompierre; but this did not daunt
the conqueror of Gabrielle d’Estrees. He had
dealt with such trifles before. As he lay groaning
with the gout he thought out a brilliant
scheme, which he amazingly proposed to M. de
Bassompierre. He sent for the young man, told
him that he was frantically in love with Charlotte,
and asked him to give up the idea of marrying
her so that the damsel should be free to
become Henri’s platonic mistress, with all her
virginal beauty untouched. And de Bassompierre
actually agreed to give up his bride.
Naturally Charlotte was deeply aggrieved, and
gave her easy-going and youthful lover such a
withering glance that he retired in mortification
to his own room and could not eat for three
days. But that did not mean that Henri was to
possess her; for, in the easy fashion of those
days, he married her to the Prince de Condé,
who was supposed to think only of hunting and
field-sports and not at all about women. But
Condé’s nature changed after marriage to a
beautiful girl, as any cynic might have expected;
and he became mightily annoyed when he saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
the king aping the young man in silks and
satins, and paying violent court to his beautiful
young wife; nor was Charlotte so discreet as she
might have been, for she received from him desperate
love-letters and poems, and answered
them erotically and foolishly. The young husband
and the elderly lover quarrelled fiercely,
and Henri lost what dignity he still possessed.
Then Condé took her away for safety to a castle
near Flanders; Henri followed, and stood by
the roadside, disguised as one of his own huntsmen,
with a patch over one eye that he might
have the joy of gazing upon her for a moment.
Seeing her at a window, he would bow and kiss
his hand, placing the other hand over his heart,
and assuming all the ridiculous antics of an
elderly lover on the stage. The Duc de Montmorency,
her father, wished Charlotte to yield
that he might gain the favour of the king.
When Condé heard this he thought he had better
take more active measures, so the young couple
hastened over the border, whither Henri could
not follow them. The actual details of the next
few months are not very interesting; they simply
represent the frantic efforts of a man who was
getting senile to gratify an adulterous passion.
It is said that he even threatened war with Spain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
for Charlotte’s bright eyes, but this is probably
not true. Henri loved his country enough to
prevent him from doing anything so wicked.
But if his prostate was not growing too large he
showed all the mental symptoms of it so far as
we can tell to-day. The incident is one of the
most painful in history, and calls for all one’s
sympathy with the “sorrows of a poor old
man.”</p>

<p>Then came Ravaillac and his dagger to end
Henri’s misery; and probably, to those who
know the inevitable end of a man suffering possibly
from enlarged prostate without modern
surgery, Providence was kind to Henri in sparing
him years of real misery and pain. Assassination
is at least a merciful death to a man
who at fifty-five has nothing to look forward to
but the “labour and sorrow” of the Psalmist.
People often wonder what further reforms he
might have effected in France; but it is the common
experience that a man does not live very
long after such an incident as that with Charlotte
de Montmorency. We cannot even guess
at the cause of this degeneration in Henri and
Marguerite. Syphilis would no doubt account
for it; but so far as I know there is no reason to
suspect it. He had done great work for France.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
Besides the merciful Edict of Nantes, which
gave freedom of worship to the French Protestants
for generations, he reformed her finances,
organised her army, and introduced the silkworm
industry which has done so much to
strengthen the people of that amazing country.
The French have long ago forgiven his sins
against morality and decency, and taken him to
their hearts as one of the greatest of Frenchmen.
And now, when his wonderful personal charm
has long mouldered to dust, the evil that he did
is interred with his bones: only the good remains
in the memory of mankind.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The best book about the troubles of old age
is <i>The Medical Aspects of Old Age</i>, by Sir
Humphrey Rolleston, which, though originally
written for doctors, should be read by every man
and woman in the land; for perhaps it would
induce in them a greater sympathy for the old
men. “Enlarged prostate” must be taken symbolically.
The whole subject of these senile attacks
of concupiscence is still under discussion,
and, just as you spared me a too close inquiry
into Elizabeth’s physical attributes, I ask you to
spare me the inquiry into those of an equally
great, but far more lovable, sovereign, Henri<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
Quatre. The incident of Henri Quatre and
Charlotte de Montmorency seems to represent
what is known as a “psychosis of involution” occurring
somewhat prematurely owing to Henri’s
hard life in the field.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Frederick_the_Great">Frederick the Great</h2>

</div>

<p>If it be true that most great men are slightly
“cracked” surely this fact is proved by the
peculiarities of Frederick the Great. I propose
to defend the memory of this most illustrious
of Prussian soldiers and minor poets
from the infamous slander that he died of
syphilis. Frederick had the misfortune to win
his glory in fighting against three women: the
Empress Maria Theresa, the Empress Elizabeth
of Russia, and Madame de Pompadour; and,
most unwisely, he tried to fight them, not only
with guns and bayonets, but with jibes and
flouts and jeers. His father, as is well known,
was King Frederick William Hohenzollern of
Brandenburg, who was famous for his regiment
of giants. These colossal creatures averaged
well over six feet high, and to find them Europe,
Asia, Africa and America were ransacked
at vast expense. Frederick William must have
been at heart a man of scientific mind, for he
experimented in breeding with these human cattle;
and doubtless his experience, had it been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
recorded with true Prussian accuracy, would
have been the forerunner of those results of the
Abbé Mendel which have laid the foundation
for the science of eugenics. Unhappily his cattle
were less submissive than Mendel’s peas or
the Chillingham bulls, for, in spite of all the
floggings and bribings to which Frederick William
resorted, he was not always successful in
securing his results. One day, when he was
going from Potsdam to Berlin, he saw a fine
strapping Saxon girl, a very giantess, whom he
at once saw would be a fit wife to produce more
gigantic toys if coupled with one of his guards;
so he stopped her and entered into conversation
with her.</p>

<p>“Art thou married, mädchen?” he asked her
in his hearty Prussian way.</p>

<p>“No, kingly majesty,” she curtsied.</p>

<p>“Take thou then this letter to the commandant
at Potsdam,” he said, “and there shall be
for thee a dollar. Here it is, in thy hand, girl”;
and putting a letter and a dollar in the girl’s
great hand, he resumed his journey to Berlin.
The blue-eyed girl knew Frederick William’s
ways, and, running on toward Potsdam, met an
ancient crone sitting by the wayside. To this
old hag, therefore, she gave the king’s gracious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
letter with strict injunctions to give it to the
commandant himself, and thereupon made the
best of her way towards home without calling
into Potsdam at all. When the commandant
read the letter he found that it was an imperative
order to marry the bearer to a certain private
soldier, and at his peril fail not; experience
had shown the commandant that his portion
would be the cane or the royal boot should
the king return and find Private Schmidt still
unwed. The ancient crone, naturally, did not
object, but Schmidt, who probably had another
fräulein in his mind’s eye, sobbed and made a
great moan. Still, there were His Majesty’s
royal orders, and they must be obeyed, so the
marriage duly took place. When the king returned
to Potsdam, he found Schmidt still blubbering
in a truly Prussian ecstasy, and the lady
still rejoicing that at the end of a doubtless ill-spent
life she had at length found a husband.
As it was obvious that this experiment in Mendelism
would be unlikely to be really successful,
there was ultimately nothing to do but to divorce
the couple, and the maiden returned home still
a maid, while the soldier ceased his lamentations.</p>

<p>This was the kind of father that fate had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
given to Frederick the Great; and his discipline
seems, from all accounts, to have been
terribly severe. At the age of about twenty
his father forced him to marry a young lady,
Christina-Elizabeth of Brunswick-Bevern, apparently
against his will. It is said that Frederick
really wanted to marry an English girl; and,
according to Lord Dover, who took his account
from the Princess of Bareith, the marriage was
never consummated, for, hardly had the candles
been put out when an alarm of fire was raised in
the castle. Frederick hastily got out of bed,
rushed to the help of the fire-fighters, and never
returned to his bride. The reason of this very
unusual action has been the subject of endless
conjecture. The princess from whose memoirs
Lord Dover drew his account was quite sure of
it, because the queen, her mother, told her so
for a fact more than a year after Frederick had
run from his bride. It is suspected that Frederick
had syphilis, and that he did not wish to
give it to the young lady; this, of course, is possible,
though it would seem to be rather unlike
the usual conduct of an eighteenth-century soldier;
and again, it is said that it was really she
who had syphilis, because some time later she
developed a trouble in her leg and was in danger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
of her life. Needless to say, that by itself
would be no evidence whatever of syphilis. Another
explanation of the desertion was that there
may have been some physiological or anatomical
trouble with the unwilling husband himself;
many years afterwards, when he was lying dead
at Sans Souci, the gallant fellows, whose unpleasant
duty it was to wash his body, took advantage
of the opportunity to examine his royal
person, and issued a special announcement that
His Late Majesty was as complete as any other
man. But Frederick really loved his wife of an
hour. He showed it by visiting her once a year
on her birthday, and, such was the honour in
which he held her, that he took off his boots for
the occasion, and visited her in his stockings. He
kept a special pair of black silk stockings just
to visit his wife in, and, as he would never permit
these to be held up with garters, they were
always hanging down his shrunken shanks in
great creases. Undoubtedly he must have loved
her, and what is more important, undoubtedly
she must have loved him, for he never washed
himself, and yet she stood him.</p>

<p>The only portrait of the young lady that I
have seen shows her to have been apparently a
rather stupid and ordinary German girl; and it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
is said that she once boasted of having had a
miscarriage to her husband. On the whole, perhaps
a good deal of unnecessary sympathy has
been poured out upon her, and doubtless that
was part of the penalty that Frederick had to
pay for having jibed at three women whom he
had made his enemies even without the jibes.
Catherine of Russia was certainly not a woman
to insult; and Madame de Pompadour was quite
able to take care of herself in a battle of tongues.
As for poor Maria Theresa, she was probably
too high and mighty, too utterly hurt at the
saints for forsaking her in her hour of need, to
condescend to answer Frederick in the bitter way
that suited himself. But Marie Antoinette held,
in common parlance, her end up. Like Maria
Theresa, her mother, she was a Habsburg, and
no doubt, like all the Habsburgs, despised these
upstarts of Hohenzollerns. It was probably
through her, or somebody equally pure-minded,
that many of the stories of Frederick’s abominable
and unnatural vices first arose. Well has
the daughter defended her mother in the combat
of slander that has signalised Frederick the
Great and his Prussia.</p>

<p>As it is vastly important to know his <i>real</i>
habits, I draw a description of them from his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
latest English biographer, Mr. Norwood Young.</p>

<p>“In later years Frederick gave up shaving, and
merely clipped at his beard with scissors. He
seldom washed any part of his person, even his
hands and face. In that respect he was very different
from his father,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> who used soap and
water freely, and often complained of his son’s
dirtiness. One of his valets concluded from his
master’s dislike of water that he must be afflicted
with a kind of hydrophobia. His height has
been variously stated, the extreme ranges being
5 feet 4 inches and 5 feet 7½ inches. He was
neither thin nor fat; in his youth he was rather
inclined to stoutness, but he became very thin
before he died. His complexion was tanned—doubtless
because it was seldom washed, like a
tramp’s to-day; but unlike a tramp’s, it was
touched up with red paint. His eyes were
prominent and blue-grey.”</p>

<p>People who never wash themselves acquire a
curious complexion which is distinguishable to a
doctor at a glance, for it is quite different from
the healthy tan of sun and air.</p>

<p>Hardly had he come to the throne when he
attacked Maria Theresa, and marched his army<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
into Silesia without warning. The iron ramrod
of the Prussians proved successful, giving Frederick’s
troops a far greater rapidity of fire than
was possible to the wooden ramrod of the Austrians.
But I am not now concerned with Frederick’s
glories, and if you are interested in them
you will get a far more vivid account of them
from Lord Macaulay than I would care to write,
even if I could; a later writer has referred scoffingly
to “Macaulay’s lurid style.” All that I
set out to prove was that this great man did not
die of syphilis, as wicked slanders have said of
him.</p>

<p>Maria Theresa humbled, and Prussia for the
first time on the map as a war-state, Frederick
returned home to a well-deserved rest, and built
himself the palace of Sans Souci, where he settled
down to form a great centre of literature
and arts on the lines of the French Academy.</p>

<p>He was hardly a German in many ways; his
favourite language was French, and his great
ambition was to be a poet. Although he could
speak three languages he could spell none; and
a writer in the <i>Quarterly</i> for 1847 gives some
instances of his peculiarities in that respect.</p>

<p>When writing a letter he used to add, in his
own handwriting, some words often of bitter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
jibe or of sardonic humour; and these words
were generally wrongly spelt. Thus, he used to
spell “winter” hiverd, “actress” actrisse, “old”
vieu, and “pay” peyer. That he never learned
to spell “pay” properly was doubtless because
he hated to think of such a thing; throughout his
life, economy was his ruling passion.</p>

<p>To improve his spelling, grammar, and poetical
construction, he invited Voltaire to stay
with him at Sans Souci, and everyone knows
that the two poets did not get on well together.
Macaulay took the squabble too seriously, and
worked himself up into a rage over it, with much
about Voltaire’s “withering irony,” and other
early Victorian and exaggerated phrases. It has
been left for Mr. Lytton Strachey, the man who
told us the truth about Queen Victoria, to tell
us the truth about the famous Voltaire-Frederick
squabble, and he makes it possible to compress it
into a phrase. They were two poets, each trying
to overreach the other. Frederick, in the eyes
of the world, won, because he had the greater
poet arrested, thus winning by the only way he
knew—by force of arms; also he dared to call
Voltaire a monkey. In our war-hospital, I remember,
we had a monkey as a pet, which used to
live at the top of one of the entrance gate-posts.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
When the descendants of Frederick the Great
used to emulate him by letting loose poison gas,
it was the duty of the quartermaster-serjeant to
put the poor little shivering beast into a gas-helmet.
At about that time Lytton Strachey’s
book came out, and I sometimes read it as I
looked at the monkey and heard the incessant
tramp of feet that, to me, is the chief remembrance
of the war, apart from the disgusting
nature of the wounds and the thundering noise.
And as the tramping men, marching to death in
interminable thousands, looked up astonished at
the monkey, I used to wonder at the effrontery
of the king who would compare one of the
greatest intellects that ever lived in France to
that of a monkey. Voltaire got his revenge,
more deadly than Marie Antoinette’s. In 1759,
the most glorious year of Frederick’s life, he
published <i>Candide</i>, which, though a joyful satire
on Leibnitz’ philosophy that this was the best of
all possible worlds, contained, if I am not much
mistaken, a far more deadly description of the
new style of civilised warfare introduced by the
Great Frederick. Listen (I quote from Mr.
Philip Littell’s translation):</p>

<p>“No,” said Dr. Pangloss, “Miss Cunegonde
was ripped open by the Bulgarian soldiers, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
having been violated by many; they broke her
father’s head for attempting to defend her; my
lady, her mother, was cut in pieces; my poor
pupil was served just the same as his sister; and,
as for the castle, they have left not one stone
upon another, not a barn, nor a sheep, nor a
duck, nor a tree.” For “Bulgarian” read “Prussian,”
and you will see the great improvements
that Frederick made in war. Voltaire, like
Anatole France, had an unrivalled power for
saying the utmost possible in the fewest words;
and yet some blockheads try to deceive themselves
by saying that Anatole France is not of
the school of Voltaire! I suppose they do so
because they have made up their minds that Voltaire
was a wicked man and an atheist, whereas
Anatole France is at least now an accepted wit
and therefore can say what he likes.</p>

<p>But two years after Voltaire died, Frederick
used to pray to his God—if he had any—“Divin
Voltaire, ora pro nobis!” that is to say, he acknowledged
that Voltaire had triumphed. This
to me seems characteristic of the man who bullied
Maria Theresa.</p>

<p>Of course the Seven Years’ War was a very
wonderful feat of endurance for the Prussian
people, just as was the Great War; and in it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
Frederick won a reputation which was marvellous
till a yet greater arose in the art of
slaughter. The history of it is repulsive, in that
it shows the triumph of unscrupulous burglary
against people who only wanted to be left in
peace. The results of our own war were better
at least on paper, though fortunately it did not
produce any man so great as Frederick.</p>

<p>But now I come to the purpose of this essay:
to show the real cause of this extraordinary
man’s death.</p>

<p>On August 4th, 1784, he attended a review in
Silesia in the midst of six hours of driving rain,
during the progress of which he refused to put
on a coat and became drenched to the skin.
Arriving home he felt ill and shivery with a constant
cough. During the autumn of that year
his fever left him, but was succeeded by a harsh
dry cough which never left him. His strength
diminished, and his legs began to swell; he had
constant oppression in his chest—that is to say,
his heart began to fail him—and he could not
breathe if he lay in bed, but had to spend his
days and nights in an arm-chair; that is to say,
he probably had what we now call “cardiac
asthma.”...</p>

<p>As the summer of 1786 gradually returned he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
began to improve, so he went from Potsdam to
Sans Souci, which he never left alive. He was
then under the care of the Court physicians,
Selle and Cothenius, and the surgeon Frese.
Unfortunately for Dr. Selle he hinted that the
great man probably had dropsy, so Frederick
flew into a rage, dismissed him, and wrote to
Hanover, where there dwelt an eminent man of
the name of Dr. Zimmermann, who arrived at
Potsdam on June 26th, 1786. When Frederick
saw him he asked at once, “Doctor, can you cure
me?” To which Zimmermann, being evidently
a courtly fellow, answered, “I can relieve you,
sir.” Zimmermann, it strikes one, must have
known that men like Selle and Cothenius would
know enough about their patient to render it
dangerous for any outsider to offer an opinion
carelessly. The first thing for Zimmermann to
do was evidently to try to gain his patient’s confidence,
because never was there a more unruly
man, especially where eating and drinking were
concerned. The doctor found that Frederick
would talk on literature and poetry as long as
he would allow him, although it made him cough
violently; and his first line of treatment was to
get Frederick to promise to read through <i>The
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>. No<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
doubt he thought that that gigantic book would
be a good way of keeping his patient quiet
for a very long time. Then the conversation
would shift to other sovereigns; and Zimmermann
was able to give Frederick some of the
truth about the health of Empress Catherine of
Russia, whose surprising immorality must have
been an attractive feature to a soldier. “But,”
said Zimmermann, “she boasts that her health
costs her only eighteenpence a year!” “Wonderful!”
applauded the aged emperor, “I always
said she was a woman of supreme genius.”</p>

<p>Then Zimmermann, seeing that Frederick was
really ill, asked that he might be allowed to have
a consultation with the dismissed Selle. This
threw Frederick into a passion; his face flushed
beneath the paint, and his eyes glowed with a
deepened fury; his voice roared with anger; one
fit of violent coughing after another came upon
him, so that Zimmermann thought it wiser to
desist, and return to his talk of scandal or literature.
But he had already gained sufficient information
to leave us a valuable report as to
the king’s physical condition. “His legs were
swollen with dropsy, which also extended up on
to the skin of the abdomen, and, though he was
not feverish, his pulse was hard and violent.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
That is to say, he was probably suffering from
a high blood-pressure with failing heart, which
was causing his dropsy.</p>

<p>Next day Zimmermann was able cautiously to
approach the question of treatment, which indeed
needed much tact, for Frederick obstinately
refused to try any of the doctor’s remedies, especially
any suggestion that he should moderate
his gigantic appetite. Zimmermann suggested
taraxacum; and after a good deal of discussion
the gallant soldier agreed to try it. Taraxacum,
or dandelion, used sometimes to be given as a
purgative that was supposed to act specially on
the liver; and no doubt Zimmermann thought
that if he could get the king’s bowels to act
freely the dropsy might be relieved.</p>

<p>But next day the doctor had once again to go
over the whole arguments. Of the three doses
of taraxacum that he had carefully measured
out with his own hands for the king, only one
had been consumed; and Frederick sat looking
with horror-stricken eyes upon the medicine glass
as though it had been a piece of artillery.</p>

<p>Frederick said enthusiastically, “I assure you
that though my legs are swelled I am not dropsical.
The only thing that is the matter with
me is that I am a little asthmatical.” Zimmermann<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
must have begun to suspect that to give
taraxacum to his unruly patient would be very
much like firing a pistol at the Rock of Gibraltar,
but he persevered with a tenacity equal to
Frederick’s own, and ultimately got him faithfully
to promise to take his medicine. In the
morning Frederick started on his medicine cautiously
little by little, and by a miracle began to
improve. Then nothing could be too good for
the Herr Doktor with his wonderful taraxacum.
It was saving the royal life. But Zimmermann
added another condition. Majesty must eat
less, and not so much of eel-pies. Then all the
glory departed out of Zimmermann. That ignorant
fellow Selle, with his balderdash about
dropsy, was a better doctor after all, and Zimmermann,
who really seems to have tried to act
in as decent a manner as was possible towards
his colleagues, allowed Selle to write and receive
reports concerning the patient’s progress even
though he was in disgrace. Frederick was a
sworn enemy to all medicines, except a powder
of his own, consisting of rhubarb and Glauber’s
salts. At any moment the taraxacum might be
thrown to the dogs, and the king’s own powder
substituted behind the physician’s back. (Between
ourselves it was not a bad powder.)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
“And,” groaned Zimmermann, “no idea could
be formed of the excess which His Majesty
allowed himself in his diet; his cooks were
obliged to season his food in a manner sufficient
to destroy his stomach; those dishes which were
the most difficult of digestion were his favourites,
especially Prussian peas, which were certainly
the hardest in the world. This was the
cause of all those attacks of vomiting and violent
pain in the stomach which attacked him
after every meal, and of the severe colic from
which he suffered every week, and nobody durst
remonstrate with him about it.”</p>

<p>Next day, when Zimmermann was sent for
hastily to see the king he found him attacked
with a terrible fit of coughing so violent that he
spat blood. This is not uncommon in cases of
very high blood-pressure, and frequently puts an
unobservant physician off the scent. Still, under
the purgative effect of the taraxacum, he began
to get gradually better, and as he felt himself
the subject of a miracle he ate more and more,
until he devoured a pie of eels so hot and so
highly seasoned that, to use the words of a
fellow-sufferer, it seemed as if it had been baked
in hell. After this he got an unusually violent
attack of colic which he attributed to the taraxacum;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
and, to use Shakespeare’s words, “Zimmermann’s
cake was dough.” Zimmermann forecasted
that Frederick would soon suffer from
bleeding hæmorrhoids, “And how will Your
Majesty like that, please?” Majesty did not
like the prospect at all, but on July 12th, when
Zimmermann left, his prophecy came to pass,
which was perhaps a good thing for the gluttonous
patient. Then Selle tried to get rid of
some of the dropsy by making incisions in his
right leg; and the ancient ingrained dirt in his
skin took a hand in the game; the cut suppurated
and became intolerably offensive. Even Selle
began to lose heart when he made a second incision
and the wound became violently inflamed
and erysipelatous. But Frederick never lost
heart: if he found that he had a more violent
indigestion than ever after his overeating, he
simply took a double dose of his own powder;
and on August 4th the erysipelatous inflammation
spread all over the leg and on to the abdomen;
blisters arose and burst, and from them
leaked a quart of fluid a day, by which treatment
the dropsy slowly abated, until, after a
struggle worthy of his struggles in the Seven
Years’ War, he gradually sank under a slow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
pneumonia, which is the natural end of man.
But it is a cruel slander upon this mighty king
to say that he died of syphilis, though occasionally
syphilis is said to cause high blood-pressure.
He was seventy-five years of age, and therefore
there were seventy-five excellent reasons for his
death. If to them you add years of gluttony
and sepsis, caused by a lifetime of dirt, you get
the real cause of the death of Frederick the
Great. Did I not say rightly that Frederick the
Great, like most other great men, was a trifle
“cracked?”</p>

<p>The poet Campbell, in the last volume of his
life of Frederick, gave a detailed account of
some of the horrors of his death-bed, but, though
interesting, they are too disgusting for my clean
pages, and I shall not inflict them on the reader.
They are chiefly concerned with the difficulty
that his friends found in getting his body in a
fit state of cleanliness for the grave. A lifetime
of ingrained dirt! No wonder the startled
washers found it necessary to get the water out
of him somehow in that hot summer weather.</p>

<p>This is the truth that lies behind the demure
paragraph of the ordinary English biographies:
“Frederick died after a long illness (which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
bore with exemplary fortitude), contracted, such
was his sense of duty, by prolonged exposure to
the rain while reviewing his troops in the province
which he had rescued from the Queen of
Hungary owing to his wonderful genius.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Childrens_Crusade_and_The_Pied_Piper">The Children’s Crusade and “The Pied Piper”</h2>

</div>

<p>Which of us can remember a time when
he did not know “The Pied Piper of
Hamelin?” Which of us can remember a time
when he thought it merely funny, or could not
recite the joyous thing by heart like his schoolfellows?
If the gliding years have stolen the
detailed memory, at least they have not stolen
the enormous impression that the poem made
upon children; for we can still see the piper with
his pin-point pupils and his light hair without
tuft on cheek nor beard on chin, and his queer
parti-coloured clothes: just like a Chinaman he
seemed to us—like the poor mysterious “John”
from whom we used to steal bananas and evoke
torrents of uncouth gibberish. Perhaps he too
was trying to tell us in his mildly explosive way
how he had talked with the Cham of Tartary
or the Nizam of Asia; perhaps he was telling us
of some other mysterious potentate for whom he
had contracted to bewitch vermin, though to be
sure we had never observed any great love for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
music in him, nor did his fingers itch to do anything
more than heave his stave on to his shoulders
or pick out faulty vegetables for the cook.
And how deliciously the piper had piped the rats
from that little mediæval town: “O rats! rejoice,
for the world is grown to one vast drysaltery!”
We did not quite know what a drysaltery was,
but to use Australian slang, it must contain things
positively “bosker” to eat. The rough and tripping
metre appealed to boyhood, and the queer
words that we did not quite understand, though
we felt that in a minute we should; such as
“nuncheon” and “justling.” It seemed quite
right and proper to say that salt sprinkled on a
candle flame would burn green; and it savours
of the “knowledge of good and evil” to know
that it really burns yellow. It is good fun to
try to reread the poem with a boy’s mind. But
it is impossible; you cannot fully surrender yourself
to the poet’s magic as a boy can, and you
catch yourself wondering how much of it is
really true; and, not content with the jolly way
in which the story is told, you wonder whether
it is “founded on fact” like so many other boys’
stories. That is the real tragedy of life, that a
time comes when you cannot be contented with
simple faith in good stories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

<p>Probably there is really some foundation for
the legend, which was not uncommon and was
told of several other towns in the Middle Ages
when grown men were really more like children
than little boys are to-day. That, I take it, is
the only way to study the Middle Ages—to remember
that the world had not yet quite grown
up and men were not as gods, but in many ways
like children. Otherwise how can you explain
many very wonderful things that undoubtedly
happened? (Not that we are particularly godlike
to-day except some men in their own estimations;
but at least some of us are beginning
to have the germs of common sense.)</p>

<p>The true foundation is much more pathetic
than Browning’s poem, which to us boys seemed
so funny, for we were not old enough to sympathise
or to see the tragedy upon which it
dances. That came later, when we learnt that
“nuncheon” is not the funniest thing in the
world and life has forced upon us a knowledge
of things other than “good and evil.” The
Koppelberg into which the children danced is
not a “mighty top”; no crowded little bones
have been unearthed from it; it is just so high
that a child would be hidden from sight as it
danced on its way to Cologne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>Of course one naturally accuses the gipsies,
for there were certainly gipsies in Europe even
so early as the twelfth century, let alone the
thirteenth; three centuries were to pass before
they reached their climax. According to the
<i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> the legend of the Pied
Piper dates from 1284, though Browning in the
poem dates it <i>July 22nd, 1376</i>. I believe the
reason for his error is not definitely known; but
I think it is possible to guess. On either date
there were plenty of gipsies about, and no doubt
they would be quite prepared to pick up an odd
child or two if they saw money in the abduction.
But it is impossible to believe that they
would dare to try any such mighty abduction as
was achieved by the Pied Piper. Europe would
have gone mad with rage; probably every gipsy
would have had his throat cut by infuriated
parents and the race would have been exterminated.</p>

<p>Nor is it likely that the so-called “Dancing
Mania” was more than in part a solution, because
that was really a spiritual reaction from
the Black Death of 1348; probably people were
so glad to have remained alive that they danced
firstly for joy, afterwards from “mass-suggestion.”
It is a partial solution of our difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
because it began in Aix-la-Chapelle in 1374; as
Hecker says, “Hardly had the graves of the victims
of the Black Death been covered in”;
which is a somewhat excitable way of saying “a
few years.” The dancing neurasthenia lasted a
long time, and recurred all over Europe in several
epidemics. Just so, after a terrible war, do
we dance to-day, though few of us, looking at
our gloomy and barbaric dances, would dream
that these short-frocked maidens are dancing for
joy. In 1375 it had spread the thirty-six miles
to Cologne, and in <i>1376</i> the few miles to
Hamelin.</p>

<p>I do not attempt to explain the episode of the
rats, beyond saying that the story is not uncommon,
that there is to this day a “Ratfanger’s
Haus” in the ancient town of Hamelin, and that
according to the original legend the piper was
accused of sorcery. Any man who studied the
habits of rats and learned how to catch them
did so in peril of being accused of sorcery; and
quite likely Browning, writing for children, made
the mayor and corporation more ridiculous by
saying that they had spent all their money in
gluttony and could not pay the rat-catcher his
fee. “A thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!”
With what shuddering delight did we hear the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
absurd and obese old mayor brave the vengeance
of the piper in those awful words. How could
he ever have had the courage to do it? The
real legend of Hamelin says that the piper was
accused of being a sorcerer.</p>

<p>But it is the children who most interest us
to-day. We must find a motive which could
excuse an atrocious crime and hold it for righteousness.
That motive we find in the Crusades;
and it has been often suggested that in the
“Children’s Crusade” we find the real foundation
of the episode.</p>

<p>Although we nowadays number the Crusades
in a charming regularity and order, probably the
people who took part in them did not realise that
they were anything but episodes in a furious and
weary struggle which, up to 1212 at least, had
had little more result than disaster and destruction.
Children saw their fathers dragged away
to the East, and, lost in a gloomy fog of war
and despair, mostly disappear for ever. Their
mothers and their priests told them that daddy
had gone to get back the tomb of Christ and save
it from wicked men; and the world was sunk in
misery and poverty and despair; up to 1212 at
least, the war had had no further result than the
capture of Acre in 1191, the elevation of Saladin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
to a pinnacle of romantic glory, the barbarous
quarrels among Christians, and the frightful attack
upon Constantinople which had led to the
destruction in hideous circumstances of that once
glorious city in 1204. In 1212 the grown men
of Europe had become heartily sick of the weary
struggle, and it occurred to the clergy that, since
it seemed likely that the tomb of Christ could
never be recovered by sinful men—and if you
read Gibbon you will see that many of the Crusaders
were exceedingly sinful, Cross and all—it
was only right to try if the innocence of little
boys might not be able to prevail over the powers
of evil. It is not suggested that the clergy really
encouraged the “Children’s Crusade,” though
some people seem to think that they did. All
the authorities that Hecker was able to consult
show that the saner of the clergy were as much
horrified by this result of the neurasthenia of
the time as the parents.</p>

<p>In Germany a little boy named Nicholas, of
whom we know nothing but his name, appeared
in <i>July, 1212</i>, and gave out that he was sent
directly from God to lead the children to the
Holy Land. Vast numbers crowded to follow
him in spite of everything that the parents could
do to keep the little people at home. Finding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
that the boys were determined to go, the parents,
with true German forethought, provided them
with “harlots” to keep them company and entertain
them on the way. Personally I believe
that for this unpleasant word we should read
“nurses,” for the average age of the boys seems
to have been rather under twelve than over.
There was a considerable number of older men
and women, whose morals suffered sadly. They
crossed the Alps in straggling swarms dignified
by the name of armies; they wore Crusaders’
uniform and bore themselves as soldiers of the
Cross; some little girls joined them in boys’
clothes—even then they couldn’t keep the girls
from following the boys into mischief, just as
to-day we cannot keep them from playing that
most dangerous game for girls, Rugby football;
the total number of the children was at least
30,000; their real starting-point was Cologne,
which you reach from Hamelin, as I have said,
after you cross the Koppelberg. Many of them
starved in the Alps or were eaten by wolves;
crowds of robbers infested them and ate their
substance and seized their clothing; they reached
Genoa and were mocked at by the sensible Italians,
who were sadly wanting in that faith which
should lead little boys to victory against black<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
men who rode about on horses and carried big
swords and shouted to Allah as they fought.
The armies scattered, and it is possible that
stragglers reached Transylvania and formed the
basis for one verse of the “Pied Piper.” Some
certainly settled in Genoa and became ultimately
rich and prosperous, but some of them tried to
return home through the wolves and mountains,
only to find their friends as mocking as the
Italians, for nothing fails like failure. Some
reached Innocent III, the pope, and after having
been made by that astute statesman to swear that
they would become Crusaders when they grew
up, were told to go back home again. A few
sturdy little fellows reached Brindisi and found
that the sea would not divide before them; they
were sold as slaves to the Saracens, and thus
reached the Holy Land, but in far other guise
than that of conquerors. Very few of them all
ever saw their mothers again.</p>

<p>This is what many people now believe to have
been the real basis of Browning’s poem, though
it is quite possible that he did not know it himself
but intended it to refer to one of the idle
legends of sorcery that I have mentioned. If he
had known it was a thing so tragic would he
have treated it in so jocular a vein?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>Even more pitiful was the tragedy of the
French children in the same year when the world
really seems to have gone mad. The leader was
a little shepherd boy of twelve, named Stephen.
Matthew Paris in ponderous language calls him
a bad little boy—I suppose he had stolen some
cleric’s apples or done something else equally
atrocious. The children in their madness called
him St. Stephen; and he worked miracles. One
morning in <i>July</i>, 1212, he thought he saw
Christ, who not only accepted a piece of bread
from Stephen’s grubby hand, but gave him a
letter to the king, and told him to lead an army
of children to the Sepulchre. The king of
France ordered Stephen not to be silly, and forbade
other little girls and boys to attend his
meetings, and the parents, so far as they could,
put them under lock and key. Just so and with
as little success might we confine behind a feeble
mediæval lock to-day a little boy who wanted
to go swimming. Very few little girls joined
Stephen. The heart-broken parents did everything
that they knew to keep their little sons
at home, and some of the boys were killed in a
mad crush to get a lock of Stephen’s hair; in
response Stephen promised that the Mediterranean
would open before them and allow them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
to reach the Holy Land dry-shod. The richer
parents sent guides; the poorer boys found their
own way to the sea. The unhappy mothers
could not tell us their feelings when they saw
their sons thus dragged away by suggestion; because
they could not write; but one would like
to know what clerk it was whom Stephen saw
and thought to be Christ. He, apparently, was
the direct cause of Stephen’s delusion; he, and
his letter.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>At length they reached Marseilles and found
the Mediterranean as blue as ever and as treacherous.
Two shipowners met them while they
were wondering why the sea had not even a tide,
far less showed signs of opening for little boys.
Let us give these shipowners their glorious names;
they were William Porcus and Hugh Ferreus.
They welcomed the boys and joined in their services,
behaving, to the boys’ eyes, as true Christians.
Stephen rejoiced in them, for all through
the south of France he had met nothing but robbers
and most unchristian men. William the Pig
and Iron-hearted Hugo offered to take them to
Palestine on shipboard for sheer love of God, as it
seemed unlikely that the sea would open to give<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
them passage as Stephen had promised. The
little boys filled seven large ships and set forth
joyfully and with cheerful shouts, singing hymns
of victory. Two of the ships were wrecked in a
storm off St. Pierre’s Rock, near Sardinia, and
every boy on board was drowned. They were the
lucky ones, because in time the survivors reached
a strange and savage land which was not Holy,
but was Egypt, where black men came on board
and bought them all as slaves; and not one of
those little boys ever reached France again. The
usual stories were set afoot that some of them had
been martyred rather than turn Moslem; but all
that is known for certain is that eighteen years
later seven hundred of them were still alive—but
no longer little boys. It does not require much
knowledge of Egypt to picture the tree of knowledge
of which those little boys had been forced to
eat. The extraordinary thing is that neither
French nor German boys seem to have known of
the deeds of the others.</p>

<p>The only light in the gloom is that the free-thinking
Emperor Frederick II afterwards laid
hands upon William and Hugo and hanged them
ingloriously with several other scoundrels. Probably
he did this on general principles, and not on
account of the little boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>Of course the frightful episode of the Children’s
Crusade is merely an instance of the extraordinary
suggestibility of children. You can
do anything with a little boy if you work upon
his imagination and subject him to “mass-suggestion.”</p>

<p>I believe that the date in the “Pied Piper of
Hamelin” is that of the dancing neurasthenia
when it attacked that town; the rat episode is a
distorted recollection of some rat-legend attributed
to Hamelin but which may have referred to
other places; the theft of the children refers to
the German branch of the Children’s Crusade,
whose Hamelin members crossed the Koppelberg
to reach Cologne.</p>

<p>And the leader’s name was Nicholas—Old
Nick?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Some_Epidemics_of_Social_Importance">Some Epidemics of Social Importance</h2>

</div>

<p>There is some reason to believe that Hippocrates
himself, our professional father, who
drew up that oath by which all modern doctors
measure their conduct, knew the bubonic plague
when he saw it, though he never went through
a plague epidemic. The first epidemic of which
we have detailed knowledge is the great plague of
Athens in the Peloponnesian War about which
there can be very little doubt, for it was described
by one of the greatest literary artists of Greece,
who saw it all with his own eyes, and suffered
from it. Thucydides was not a doctor, but like
Cervantes he had the eye and mind of a doctor;
and he could describe a disease so plainly that
many other ancient and even mediæval historians
have taken their descriptions of their own epidemics
straight from his with never an acknowledgment.
And in Thucydides’ account of that
plague we get the invariable conditions of all epidemics—the
ungovernable terror of the people,
the powerlessness of the doctors, the abandonment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
of all moral laws, the wild accusations of
poisoning by enemies, the selfishness, cowardice,
and ignorance of man in a panic, the hysterical
dancing in the shadow of the tomb. From this
one learn all.</p>

<p>I give a translation of Thucydides’ description
of the symptoms, by C. Foster Smith. It must be
remembered that Athens was being besieged and
the Athenians had brought all the farmers into
Athens so that the Spartans should find no food
for the Lacedæmonian armies; the device of an
already beaten nation.</p>

<p>“The disease began in Ethiopia and then descended
into Egypt and Libia. Then it suddenly
fell upon the Piræus and city of Athens, so that
people at first said that the Peloponnesians had
put poison into the cisterns. Afterwards it
reached the upper city also, and from that time
the mortality became greater. I have had the disease
myself and seen others sick of it. Suddenly
men were seized first with an intense heat of the
head and redness and inflammation of the eyes,
and the parts inside the mouth became bloodshot
and exhaled an unnatural and fœtid breath. In
the next stage sneezing and hoarseness came on
and in a short time the disorder descended to the
chest attended by severe coughing and sneezing.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
There was severe vomiting of every kind attended
by great distress; and in most cases ineffectual
retching producing violent convulsions which
sometimes abated directly, sometimes not very
long afterwards. The body was not very hot to
the touch; it was not pale, but reddish, livid, and
breaking out into small blisters and ulcers. Patients
could not bear to have on them the slightest
covering or linen sheets, but wanted to be quite
uncovered and would have liked best to throw
themselves into cold water—indeed, many who
were not prevented did so. Most of them died
on the seventh or ninth day from internal heat,
but had still some strength left. After the crisis
the disease sometimes attacked the privates and
fingers and toes, so that many patients lost these,
though some lost the eyes also. Immediately
after recovery there was often loss of memory, so
that many failed to remember either themselves
or their friends. The most dreadful thing was
the despondency of the victims.”</p>

<p>I am glad to say that I personally did not serve
in the Balkan campaigns, but many doctors who
did tell me that Thucydides’ description might,
with a little imagination, be stretched to include
that plague which proved so distressing to Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
Elsie Inglis and her gallant band. In other words,
Thucydides was describing typhus fever, which
has always been the enemy of besieged cities, especially
in hot and dirty surroundings. Dr. Crawfurd
states that we may look upon it as almost
certain that the plague of Athens was typhus
fever, though he discusses at considerable length
the academic question whether it might not have
been bubonic plague or smallpox. At least we
can say for certain that the plague of Athens
showed more of the symptoms of typhus fever
than of any other known disease; and if Dr.
Crawfurd is wrong he had made a very shrewd
guess. From my own experience of typhus,
which is small, I should certainly be inclined to
support him. But typhus nowadays is a thing
almost of the past except in times of war. That
we owe simply to washing ourselves and our
clothes better than of old. It is a remarkable
thing in clinical experience that typhus frequently
accompanies bubonic plague, because they are
both diseases of primitive civilisations like India
and China to-day.</p>

<p>Passing over the innumerable ancient attacks
of pestilence upon mankind, we come to the great
plague of the Antonines which was probably the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
real cause of the decline and fall of the Roman
Empire, for it is extremely doubtful whether the
Empire ever recovered from it. To most of us
this plague is remarkable for the fact that Galen,
the Roman Hippocrates, ran away from it, and
has left us an account of it which seems to have
been drawn second-hand from Thucydides. In
the Roman Empire many of the physicians were
Greek slaves and had the slave mind. Though
Galen himself was not a slave, still he was a man
of his time, and it was not then thought imperative
that a doctor should, in Dr. Crawfurd’s
words, be “captain of his soul.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Dr. Crawfurd
gives many instances of honoured names whose
owners ran before the onset of plague; and it was
not till the Black Death that we find the real true
silent courage that we now expect from the medical
profession as a matter of course.</p>

<p>The plague of the Antonines seems to have varied
in different parts of the Empire and at different
times of its devastating career.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Occasionally
it seems to have taken the appearance of smallpox,
sometimes of typhus, and perhaps at times<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
an infusion of bubonic plague may have thrust
in its frightful form. It would be much easier
for after generations to guess at the truth if only
poor Galen had not taken wing and fled; for he
was an acute clinician. At its first onset he fled to
Campania and, finding no safety there, took ship
to Pergamos. Thence, after two years’ absence,
he returned at the urgent summons of the emperor,
Marcus Aurelius Antoninus, and after a
brief stay in Rome rejoined him again at Aquileia.
But there was no rest for his weary soul; again
pestilence pursued him. The thing would be
comic if we could forget the frightful misery of
mankind when the foundations of civilisation
were crumbling before the assaults of micro-organisms.
Man was engaged in one of his greatest
battles to the death against the wild; and the
rat, the body-louse, and the direct infection of
smallpox were apparently leagued in an assault
upon his works. It is a dramatic thing to stand
before the great statue of Marcus Aurelius at the
head of the Capitoline steps in Rome, near the
smell of the caged wolves, and to ponder that the
real enemy of that somewhat tedious emperor
was, not the Quadi or the Marcomanni, but,
unknown to himself, if Dr. Crawfurd is right, the
ignoble body-louse and the squeaking, fighting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
greedy Mus Decumanus.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> And yet he sits there
so proudly upon his wonderful horse, looking
every inch an emperor yet unable to cast even a
moral maxim at his ignoble foes.</p>

<p>After the plague of the Antonines we come to
the great plague of Justinian and here at last we
have the evidence of an exact historian who did
not run and could state what he saw in language
that we can understand. Gibbon says hesitantly
that Procopius was a doctor, though probably in
truth he was a lawyer. Possibly he was too much
afraid of the naughty little Empress Theodora,
whom he was afterwards to slander, to forsake
the path of duty and run away when the world
seemed dying; but at any rate he has left us a remarkable
account of the plague of 542, one of the
most terrible recorded visitations of epidemic disease;
and after reading Gibbon’s somewhat excitable
account of it I think that few doctors will
deny that it was real old bubonic plague that has
so often made history. Justinian suffered from it
and recovered; we do not know enough about the
exact circumstances to estimate its exact effects
upon the world; but we can be pretty certain that
the bacillus pestis did not lay waste the Byzantine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
Empire for nothing. Gibbon estimates the total
loss of life at a hundred millions; but one doubts
if the population of the Roman Empire, even in
its palmiest days, was ever much larger, and
surely the plague could not have swept off everybody
in the known world, though we do know
that, if it really breaks loose in flea-bitten surroundings,
plague can do an infinity of mischief,
probably more than any other known disease.</p>

<p>We leave the dead old world that shook at
Cæsar’s nod, and leap in one moment to the very
beginnings of the modern world, to the Black
Death of 1348; for, though the Middle Ages were
still to drag their slow length along for at least
a century, there can be little doubt that after the
Black Death had terrified mankind all our modern
problems were beginning, if only in embryo.
The original source of it seems to have been
China, and the epidemic proceeded with most
leisurely footsteps until it took ship for Europe.
Dr. Hecker<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> in 1833 wrote an exhaustive account
of it from mediæval records; but since 1833
the cell-theory of Schleiden and Schwann has
revolutionised medicine, and even Dr. Hecker
has to be translated into modern terminology; so
rapidly has medicine changed that a book written<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
ten years ago is already obsolete. Indeed, it is
not too much to say that more has been discovered
in medicine within the last thirty years than in
the whole previous half-million years during
which man has been upon the earth; one sometimes
becomes terrified at the amazing growth of
knowledge. Whither is it all leading us? Are
we becoming as gods? Vespasian joked about
himself when he was dying; let us not really grow
“pumpkinified,” to use Seneca’s words about
Claudius, when we think ourselves becoming deified.</p>

<p>The Black Death seems to have come to Europe
from Africa by ship in 1348. The harbingers of
the epidemic began in 1347 with earthquakes and
floods in China and Egypt; in far-away China
the earth opened and swallowed men. Frightful
portents appeared in the sky (of course I am simply
quoting this nonsense from Hecker and his
mediævalists) and the seasons changed, summer
becoming winter. At that time, according to
Hecker, the sheet of ice was formed which has
since prevented men from looking upon the coast
of Greenland; there were unequalled rains and
the floodgates of heaven were opened in a more
than Noachian deluge. Vast swarms of locusts
appeared and died; and the want of the crops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
which they had devoured thrust man, whose hold
upon the earth is always so feeble, to the edge of
that slight precipice which generally protects him
from the Valley of Starvation. The earth opened,
and into the crevasses men fell, never to be seen
again; from the crevasses arose a horrid stench.
Into this world, even more starved and terrified
by the adventure of living than was common in
the Middle Ages, the rat and the bacillus pestis
made their death-dealing plunge. The epidemic
which they brought seems to have been carried
from the sultry delta of the Nile by ship to Greece
and Italy; four fugitives—and unknown numbers
of rats and fleas—fled to find safety in Marseilles,
carrying their own destruction with them.
Thence the plague went to Avignon, at that time
the residence of the pope; and ultimately to England
where it landed in the southwest counties,
taking half a year to crawl to London. As acutely
noted by Procopius, plague always spreads inland
from the shores of the sea, and we now know that
it spreads just so fast as the rat can run and no
faster. In 1348 they knew nothing about rats
and bacteria, but attributed everything to bad air
or evil spirits; and they noted that there was a
continuance of southerly winds, which of course
in Greece and Italy are hot winds and may possibly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
have spread the plague by bringing the ships
and their contained rats. In Germany they had
some story about a dense pestiferous fog which
smelt abominably and so was obviously the cause
of the Black Death. It is difficult to say how
much truth there was in these stories of fog,
though they are too numerous and too well attested
to be utterly ignored; they have naturally
been seized upon by historical novelists in search
of the dramatic and anxious to show that in 1348
everything was different from things as they are
to-day. Possibly they accounted for the preponderance
of pneumonic plague.</p>

<p>John Cantacuzenos, Byzantine emperor, whose
own son died of it, left a description that entirely
fits in with our modern knowledge of plague,
buboes, black spots and all, though there is a
certain resemblance to Thucydides which makes
one rather believe that he was adding to his narrative
for dramatic effect. Strangely modern is
his description of the dull stupor that affects so
many plague patients to-day. We all noticed it
in the slight epidemic that affected Sydney some
years ago. Then again John specially stated that
some patients were attacked by a violent pain in
the chest, with difficulty of breathing and a putrid
expectoration. This looks uncommonly like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
pneumonic type of plague which proved so destructive
in Manchuria in 1910.</p>

<p>But the most interesting feature of the Black
Death was its attack upon Avignon, where Guy
de Chauliac was physician to the pope. It lasted
eight months, with the usual concomitants of
numbers of dead so huge that the living could
not bury them. As trench after trench became
filled, no matter how hard the living worked, the
pope blessed the Rhone and had the bodies hurled
into that rushing stream, doubtless to the joy of
the rats. Guy himself showed the courage that
one expects in a modern doctor, and has left us a
perfectly recognisable description, which is commented
upon by both Dr. Hecker and Dr. Crawfurd.
It is in Guy himself that our interest
dwells; for at last Medicine had found its soul.
His colleagues, being trained in Arabian medicine,
all told him that the plague was inevitably
fatal, that medicine could do nothing, and that
he was only courting destruction by staying to
comfort those whom he knew that he could not
save. Guy himself had a theory that strong
purgation would cure the disease, though he
knew that the only real safety was in flight. He
stayed; though whether he was prevented from
running by the medicines that he prescribed or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
by sheer courage no one can say. His own words
were “As for me I did not dare absent myself,
though I was in constant fear.” To be feared
of a thing and yet to do it—that is what makes
the prettiest kind of a man; and to be afraid only
of his own conscience makes a man a hero. Guy
was afraid of his own conscience, not of the
plague, and therefore he has become one of the
heroes of medicine. No doubt he donned his
quaint mediæval anti-infection costume with its
beaky vizor, and went from door to door trying
to bring a little hope to the gloomy death-beds of
the frightened people; no doubt he had himself to
clean up the mess caused by his treatment, which
must have been calamitous. But he lives in the
memory of his colleagues, for we are all proud to
belong to the profession of that simple-minded
doctor of Provence, and try to act like him though
with less messy treatment. He was a brave man.</p>

<p>The epidemic endured at Avignon for eight
months, and Guy tells us that for the first three it
took the form, in our terminology, of pneumonic
plague and was intensely infectious, but for the
other five it seems to have been the ordinary bubonic
that was so fatal in London in 1665. Guy
remained in Avignon for the Black Death, and
faced its return twelve years later. In the first<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
visitation the poor suffered, but in the second the
rich; but, rich or poor, Guy remained at his post
with his ample store of aloes to win the love of
the dying whom he could not save. We know
now some results of crude aloes which are not
very pleasant, and I wonder whether Master
Guy de Chauliac ever noticed them, or whether
his patients ever came running to him to cure
them of the effects of his aloes.</p>

<p>To sum up, it is probable that the series of epidemics
that we call the Black Death were all different
varieties of the plague; bubonic, pneumonic,
septicæmic, hæmorrhagic, etc. The sentimental
and journalistic Nordic nations, such as
the English and Germans, muttered the horrified
name “Black Death,” afraid to give the thing a
name, just as to-day they talk about the “Red
Plague” or “a certain loathsome disease” when
they mean to say syphilis; but the more clear-sighted
and logical Mediterranean peoples knew
that the thing certainly killed them, though they
did not know what it was, so they simply called
it La Grande Mortelaga—the Great Mortality,
which it assuredly was. We prosaic moderns simply
call it the plague, whose dread name even to-day
makes us shudder. We do not fear it, because
we know exactly how it is spread, and that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
to use Osler’s epigrammatic words, all that one
needs to defeat an epidemic of plague is a stout
heart and a long purse. During the fourteenth
century men’s hearts, being very ignorant, were
not very stout, and their purses were atrociously
short. It would hardly be too much to say that
during the Middle Ages, and up till about 1700,
the greatest cause of death in cities was the
plague. After 1700 people slowly began to become
rich, and to build better houses which would
keep the rat at a distance, so that man conquered
the plague without knowing how he had done it.
But the conditions in the Middle Ages must have
been frightful. Listen to the words of Dr.
Abram in <i>English Life and Manners in the Later
Middle Ages</i> about the overcrowding, which
would put even Glasgow to shame. He is referring
to the Miller of Trumpington in Chaucer’s
<i>Reve’s Tale</i>; and the miller cannot have
been a very poor man; he was prosperous and on
edge for his dignity. But in his house there was
only one bedroom, where slept he himself, his
wife, his baby, his grown-up daughter, and two
undergraduates from Cambridge all at once.</p>

<p>No wonder the rats and fleas were rampant and
the plague swept over the land. And as for the
personal cleanliness of these crowded peoples,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
there was none.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> If I wished to use another
jargon than medical I would say it was a minus
quantity, but personally I prefer the medical,
because that means something and is exact.</p>

<p>The Black Death revived that strange and
mournful sect of the flagellants, the Brotherhood
of the Cross. The spirit of man, which is capable
of such wonders, must needs bow before that
shadow of itself which it has projected into the
infinite, and ask pardon of its anthropomorphic
fourteenth-century God for the fancied sins which
had brought these horrors upon the world. The
quaint figures of the flagellants wandered, cross
on breast, in doleful procession all over Europe,
chanting dolorous hymns of misery that bore the
seeds of rebellion against that very God whom
they affected to supplicate. They would reach a
church, lie down in circles, strip off their clothing
and flog each other with scourges of nails. People
crowded to watch the blood flow, while doubtless
the rats and fleas rejoiced if rejoicing be possible
to beings so lowly. In these flagellants
probably lay the real seeds of the Reformation
which was to come. They sometimes seized upon
a church and rebelliously conducted Mass without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
an authorised priest, although the pope,
Clement VI, who was a brave man and faced the
plague like a hero, had given absolution in advance
to every patient who should be taken sick.
Man wanted his own priest, and sometimes when
he sent in his last extremity his priest would not
come, or was dead of the plague, so that when the
epidemic had abated, and the world was struggling
to recover itself and reap the neglected harvests,
men were only too ready to believe the stories
about the priests and their women which
were even then paving the way for the Reformation.
The Statute of Labourers, in England, was
the herald of many of our modern political ideas.
Those unhappy men who died, stupefied by
plague, were really dying for humanity.</p>

<p>We cannot make an accurate guess even at the
actual number of people lost during the Great
Mortality. Hecker, after taking the utmost
trouble, thought that at least a fourth of the
people of Europe perished, but in some places
far more; thus in Avignon, of which we have the
most exact information, about nine-tenths. This
vast mortality in Avignon was not caused by de
Chauliac and his aloes, any more than it was due
to Pope Clement and his blessing. Probably de
Chauliac’s treatment had no influence one way or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
the other; neither did the question of pope and
anti-pope nor the great schism. But we know
more about what happened at Avignon than anywhere
else, because de Chauliac was a brave doctor
who told the truth.</p>

<p>We do not forget the plague, because it takes
very good care of that, and is still, though we have
long purses, the nightmare of health officials who
keep their silent watch over the health of mankind.</p>

<p>But, in dealing with epidemic diseases that
have affected civilisation we must not forget
malaria. Like syphilis itself, its social effects
have been prodigious. Malaria was undoubtedly,
with typhus and possibly smallpox, one of the
real causes of the fall of the Roman Empire. The
work of Sir Ronald Ross in discovering that it is
spread by the anopheles mosquito, is one of the
great epoch-making discoveries of history. There
are few countries in the world which are free from
malaria to-day. Unquestionably it is the cause
of the anæmia and poor physique of the inhabitants
of most tropical countries; and Australia is
fortunate in having so few anopheles mosquitoes,
though we have so many other varieties of the
abominable little pests. That the numerous returned
soldiers who were infected with malaria<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
in Palestine have comparatively rarely spread
their disease is due to the rarity of the anopheles
in Australia; but doctors are always on the lookout
for this particular pest and let us hope will
keep it to its natural habitat in moister countries.
Probably the real reason of the good physique
of Australians is that the British race, for the first
time in history, has had the chance of developing
in a warm climate with no malaria. We are
making a mistake in concentrating on the search
for the discovery of the will-o’-the-wisp cause of
cancer, which, though a very terrible and horrible
disease, possibly associated into the very mystery
of life itself, has probably less important social
effects than either syphilis or malaria. I do not
merely refer to the actual death-rate from these
diseases, though it is probable that syphilis indirectly
causes more deaths than cancer, tuberculosis
or overeating. The trouble is that syphilis
works in so mysterious a way; it is sly and subtle
in its effects; it lies long latent and springs up
again to the slaughter after the man who is
its victim has long forgotten that he ever had it;
and it conceals itself under innumerable guises.
The great problem before the civilised world to-day
is not the cure of cancer; it is the prevention
of syphilis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span></p>

<p>We know exactly how to prevent syphilis in
the male. Metchnikoff and Calmette have
shown us by experimental proof that is irrefragable.
That their method is impossible to apply
satisfactorily in the female owing to anatomical
reasons is no reason whatever for so solemnly
concealing its existence from young men, because,
if it were generally known to the male, the females
would not be affected and the contagiousness
of the disease would die out in one generation.
It is painful to think of the vast mortality
and misery that is caused by this one disease when
every decent doctor knows exactly how to prevent
it. With moral education in self-restraint
together with application of Metchnikoff’s discoveries,
which are known to every doctor, there
is no reason whatever why syphilis should not
be entirely abolished from the educated world.
The other venereal diseases though serious are
of comparatively minor importance; even gonorrhœa,
which sterilises so many women and
blinds so many babies, is less important because
it does not affect the brain.</p>

<p>My own opinion is, that while moral education
should certainly be attended to, every boy should
have a quiet talk with his doctor before he goes
to boarding-school and still better perhaps before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
he goes to the university. It is common experience
that more lads become infected while they
are young and ignorant, during the time of their
university life, than at any other time.</p>

<p>We have apparently got over our post-war epidemic
of influenza, which sensationally minded
people called the Black Death without knowing
what they said. But has fate altogether done
with us? Has the war really left no other sequel
than the influenza? Only this morning I was
reading an article by Mr. Stephen Graham in the
<i>Nineteenth Century and After</i>, in which he refers
to the frightful post-war corruption of women in
London, as shown by the mad competition among
prostitutes for the favours of men. I can corroborate
that article fully, for last year I went
travelling over many parts of Europe, and I was
impressed and horrified by exactly the same thing.
A man cannot leave his hotel unaccompanied
without being set upon by these women, who are
evidently starving and desperate. London, Paris,
and Rome are all the same; there is nothing to
choose between them.</p>

<p>Nothing seems to be done about this frightful
menace. Let us take care lest a rival to the Black
Death may ruin the people of Europe. Immorality
must be paid for somehow; and it does no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
good for politicians to wrangle over trifles such
as the German restitutions when there is a very
much more dreadful menace knocking at the
world’s doors.</p>

<p>During Tudor times, when the world seems
to have been almost at its lowest stage of filth,
there were great epidemics of typhus fever in
Europe, especially in Italy; thus reviving memories
of Athens and the Roman Empire, which to
the eyes of modern men seem to have been an
age of beauty. Typhus is beyond all other diseases
the disease of filth, war, and misery; and
that it spread so vigorously in the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries seems to show that things at
that time were less romantic than people try to
depict. Probably, if we could get at the real
truth, throughout recorded history, typhus has
slain more people than any other epidemic disease,
possibly even more than the plague itself.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt as to the identity of
the “Sweating Sickness” of Tudor times. It
seems to have begun with the bloodshed of the
Wars of the Roses, as the army of Henry VII
marched in misery, slush, and triumph after the
battle of Bosworth. Very soon after the king’s
entry into London the sweating sickness began
to spread among the overcrowded houses of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
capital. It ravaged high and low; at first it
spread largely among young and vigorous men;
in one week it took two lord mayors and six
aldermen. The coronation of Henry VII was
postponed by reason of the general distress, and
the disease spread without interruption over the
whole country. Nobody seemed to be immune;
and when it attacked Oxford the professors and
students fled alike in a common terror, so that
the ancient university was as deserted as it was,
for a more worthy reason, during our late war.</p>

<p>After its first appearance, sudden and savage,
the English Sweat for a time abandoned its victims,
and the mediæval world resigned itself to
its normal accompaniments of epidemic typhus,
smallpox, and plague. Soon after the return of
Columbus we begin to hear of a new and terrible
disease, syphilis,<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> though there has been great
argument as to whether it may not have been
yaws, which is a comparatively mild tropical long-continued
ailment. To my mind the fact is convincing
that we find no real traces of syphilis in
the bones from ancient burial-places. If it had
existed in the ancient world we should certainly
have found such evidences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>But the English Sweat was only biding its
opportunity; for it returned mildly in 1506;
and again severely in 1517; and again, in its
worst epidemic, in 1528. By this time the world
was beginning to think that we were eternally
damned; and when in 1529, it spread to Hamburg,
the good North Germans tried to signify
their belief in the usual manner by confining
their patients in the best replica of hell that
they could imagine. Every patient, whatever his
sickness, was hidden under a heap of featherbeds;
the stove was driven to its full force; the
windows shut and sealed with rags; and the
patient’s relatives heaped themselves upon him
until it sometimes happened that he was actually
smothered by their well-meant efforts.</p>

<p>Besides the sweat, influenza recurred again and
again; and slew its thousands and tens of thousands.
It probably so weakened Mary Tudor’s
heart that she died suddenly while hearing Mass.</p>

<p>Now what was this dreadful Sweating Sickness
which so paralysed over and over again the strong
arm of the Tudors? Osler describes it confidently
as what we call miliary fever; a disease which
now and then breaks out in little valleys of Italy
and Eastern Europe; kills a few harmless people;
and suddenly departs as quickly as it came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>Of course there must always be doubt as to all
these mediæval epidemics. One symptom may
impress one doctor as due to one special disease,
another symptom may impress another as the
most important. Thus, thinking of the plague of
Athens, what impressed me most was the fact that
Thucydides expressly mentioned the fact that the
patient’s fingers and genitals used sometimes to
drop off when he seemed on the high road to
recovery. We see just the same symptom in
epidemic typhus to-day.</p>

<p>It is difficult exactly to understand ancient
pathological terms; when an ancient observer says
“peticula” or “bubo” or “macula” or uses other
learned terms, we cannot be quite sure that he
means to convey exactly the same idea as the
words imply to ourselves. There is always room
for honest difference of opinion. But after carefully
reviewing the diseases of old I fancy most
people will agree with Sydney Smith when he
wrote:</p>

<p>With all the glamour that enthusiasts and
romanticists have cast upon the Middle Ages we
are probably very much happier to-day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="F_W_Nietzsche">F. W. Nietzsche</h2>

</div>

<p>I had long shared the general belief that this
remarkable man died of general paralysis;
but a brief study of the facts as they are set forth
in Frau Foster-Nietzsche’s book, <i>The Lonely
Nietzsche</i>, will convince any fair-minded person,
as they did me, that such an hypothesis is untenable.
As Nietzsche was undoubtedly one of
the makers of the modern mind it will be worth
while to study his health a little, for the more
we study it the more remarkable he becomes.</p>

<p>From youth onwards he was subject to dreadful
headaches, often accompanied by vomiting
and intense pain in the eyes. He had temporary
strokes of paralysis, and sometimes lost the power
of speech. Probably the disease from which he
suffered was what we now call migraine or “sick
headache.” This is a trouble that is almost confined
to persons of active and intelligent mind,
and the cause of it is quite unknown. Nietzsche,
imagining that his headaches had something to
do with his digestion, used to starve himself and
lead the most ascetic life; but all to no purpose.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
Starvation rather tends to make the patient worse.
As a rule this sickness tends to improve as the
patient grows older; but in Nietzsche’s case
advancing age brought no relief. Work was impossible,
and he had to get leave of absence from
his position as Professor of Classical Philology in
the University of Basel in 1876. Later on he
tried to resume work, but spent many years in
wandering from one health resort to another in
almost constant pain; indeed, he said that for
him two hundred days out of every year were
days of pain.</p>

<p>This migraine is a very terrible complaint
which affects mostly the elect of the earth: those
whose brains are far above the average. Women
are more often affected by it than men; and in
them it appears to become worse periodically and
at the climacteric. Afterwards it generally leaves
them. Clods do not suffer from migraine; the
trouble appears to be one of the prices that very
clever men have to pay for their brains. Sufferers
from it are generally very prone to seasickness
and to trainsickness, and once an attack is in
full blast no treatment whatever but natural sleep
seems to relieve it. The pain appears to be so
terrible that the stomach is paralysed by the sheer
violence of it, and such drugs as aspirin, phenacetin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
and even opium pills are useless because they
are at once vomited. Sometimes symptoms indistinguishable
from those of migraine persist for
many years in cases of chronic Bright’s disease;
and there is reason to suspect that it may be accompanied
by some sudden constriction of an
artery in the brain. In the worst cases the pain
also affects the eye; and occasionally there is confusion
of speech or even positive aphasia. Possibly
even a stroke of paralysis may occur, and
there is the usual fear of insanity that seems to
accompany all nervous troubles in highly neurotic
men.</p>

<p>Late in the year 1888 the blow fell; and Nietzsche
became definitely insane. Nietzsche’s sister
has left us quite a good account of it which
enables us to guess with a certain amount of probability
the actual nature of his insanity; though
we must always remember that he had been suffering
from this terrible agony for years and had
already had strokes that were probably due to a
temporary constriction of a cerebral artery.</p>

<p>During the latter end of 1888 Nietzsche was
even more than usually worried; sensitive old
women, Wagnerians and all the little people were
writing him abusive letters. Something had to
go. Either angry people must leave him alone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
or the delicate filament of Nietzsche’s mind must
snap. It had already been strained past endurance
by his headaches and pains in the eye and
incessant self-denial. The first symptom seems
to have been that his Italian landlady noticed that
Professor Nietzsche had suddenly taken to imbibing
gigantic draughts of water. Suddenly,
while he was walking near his home, he fell down
in the street and could not get up again; that is
to say, probably one of his cerebral arteries had
gone into a state of spasm. His landlord found
him and helped him home, where he lay for two
days on a sofa in a lethargic, probably semi-conscious,
state; he would not say a word nor answer
questions. When he awoke to the world again he
was deranged. He talked loudly to himself and
would not allow people into his room, for he said
he was composing an oratorio. He had always
been interested in music. He began to write wild
letters to his friends and relatives, accusing them
of all sorts of silly things, but, be it observed, of
nothing indecent. Then he began to accuse himself
of fancied extravagance. When he met Professor
Oberbeck he ran towards him and embraced
him, saying, “My dear fellow, I hope
you’ve brought me money; I’ve been living so extravagantly!”
Nietzsche extravagant; a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
who was a byword for asceticism and who did not
even then realise the fame and fortune that was
beginning to come to him! When they examined
his papers they found 900 francs among them.
They took him to Jena, where he was admitted to
an asylum. Unhappily his friends had no specimen
of his handwriting to assist the asylum doctors,
and as it was before the days of the cerebro-spinal
Wassermann test, it is not surprising that
the poor doctors, driven to give the thing a name,
hinted at general paralysis, though they seem to
have eaten their words later.</p>

<p>The ordinary typical case of general paralysis
is much as follows: An apparently perfectly sane
and normal man suddenly goes out and orders a
dozen motor-cars, or twenty-three cameras, or
fifty arm-chairs, or a dozen sets of gymnastic apparatus
or something equally silly; then he goes
home to his wife very well pleased with himself
and boasts how he has suddenly become the best
cyclist in Europe or the most famous cricketer.
No doubts for him, gladsome fellow! Probably
he will also tell her that he is God. Or perhaps
he will indecently assault some little girl before
the very eye of some hitherto friendly policeman.
Sometimes the disease will begin with purely
neurasthenic and gloomy symptoms, so that even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
a clever doctor may be put off the scent for
months or years. But when he is examined carefully
it will generally be found that his hand is
tremulous so that he cannot write intelligibly; his
tongue trembles and perhaps wobbles in and out
like a trombone; his speech is indistinct; the pupils
of his eyes may be unequal or not circular.
Later come the fits and increasing dementia that
haunt him till his death.</p>

<p>The fact that Nietzsche suffered from doubts
about money and showed no sign of obscenity
seems to point to a totally different form of insanity.
Faithful to the principle that no doctor
ought to offer a diagnosis without having seen
the patient, I hesitate to say definitely what was
the matter with Nietzsche, especially as Dr. Oscar
Levy of Hamburg is still alive and knows the
Nietzsche case intimately; but I should not wonder
if the poor overwrought man was suddenly
seized by something akin to melancholia,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> that
last infirmity of sensitive minds. As clods do
not suffer from migraine they comparatively
rarely attain to the heights—or depths—of
melancholia. Under the influence of nursing,
rest and protection from the attacks of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
world, he partly recovered, but, as generally happens
with melancholia in middle age, he seems to
have become more emotional and partly demented
before the chronic trouble that may have caused
his headaches ultimately killed him. Throughout
his insanity the difficulty in speaking pursued
him. “I don’t speak prettily,” he would pathetically
say; and after a tremor that may have been
uræmic he passed away.</p>

<p>No philosopher has been more shockingly misrepresented
to the British public; and now that
the bitterness of the war is over it is quite time
that we should make some effort to understand
what he intended. The famous “superman” was
not a big bullying German <i>picklehaube</i>; it seems
to have represented what a man might become if
freed from conventional repression: if his instincts
were perfect in every way. The “will to
power” was not the arrogance that caused the
war; as a matter of fact, no man ever attacked
German militarism so fiercely as did Nietzsche.
It really represented what the modern evolutionist
means by survival value in all organisms.
Possibly Nietzsche made a mistake in attributing
prudery to the effects of Pauline Christianity; the
very essence of prudery is now thought to lie in
unconscious regrets of the old for their lost sexual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
power. It seems to be a frustrated wish-fulfilment
and is found among people who worship
mumbo-jumbo, as well as among those who pretend
to follow Jesus.</p>

<p>Nietzsche did well to point out, as Huxley
pointed out years ago, that “all men are <i>not</i> born
free and equal,” as optimists have averred. A
little healthy pessimism would be very good for
the world; it would teach it to be more careful
about paying its debts and would prevent it from
blundering into an ignorant war such as the last
one.</p>

<p>But nobody who has ever seen the disgusting
spectacle of a man dying of general paralysis,
demented, helpless, lying bestial, an obscene body
that has long survived its soul, deserted by every
one but his mother and his old aunts, could ever
look at the portrait of the dying Nietzsche, gazing
so wistfully into the setting sun, and say that
Nietzsche died of general paralysis. The Italians
called him Il Santo, the Saint; so far did he
seem to them above all moral frailty.</p>

<p>It was probably owing to his incessant pain
that he could never settle down to systematise
his philosophy, but had to write in epigrams.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Arthur_Schopenhauer">Arthur Schopenhauer</h2>

</div>

<p>It is difficult not to smile at this peculiar philosopher,
even though he has obtained nearly
as many admirers as Nietzsche himself, and it is
a dangerous thing to offend a Nietzschian. But
let us treat him with the seriousness that he would
have insisted upon as his right.</p>

<p>He was born in Dantzig in 1788; he died in
Frankfurt-am-Main in 1860, a philosopher to
whom both Germany and England have laid
claim, because his father wished him to be born
in England, and took his mother there just before
the expected birthday, but the good lady suddenly
took fright at the English—is it possible
that there can have been anybody on earth who
has not liked the English?—and insisted on going
back to Germany for the confinement. I have
actually heard that to this very natural whim of
a pregnant woman is to be attributed Arthur’s detestation
of women! In that idea perhaps we
may see the natural thought of all Englishmen
that England is the only fit country for a man
to be born in. But his father had his revenge;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
for he called the little son “Arthur” and the lady,
being a dutiful German wife, had to submit, consoling
herself by the thought that it was a German
as well as an English name. But Arthur’s
detestation of women is probably to be attributed
to a more physical cause, as we shall see.</p>

<p>In 1793 Dantzig was annexed by Prussia, so
the Schopenhauers moved to Hamburg. Later
on, when the question of Arthur’s education came
to be settled, they decided to send him to both
France and England; and in London the future
pessimist was placed at a boarding-school kept
by a clergyman at Wimbledon—poor little boy.
For some reason he found the life, and more particularly
the religious training of the good schoolmaster,
intensely irksome; and long afterwards
he referred with disgust to the atmosphere of cant
and hypocrisy which permeated England at that
time. <i>Tempora mutantur nos et mutamur in
illis.</i></p>

<p>In 1807 his father was found dead in the canal
at Hamburg, being suspected to have thrown himself
from an upper story; and Arthur, out of respect
for his father’s wishes, definitely took up
his duties in an office, though personally he longed
to be an author. His mother, being now free
from the encumbrance of a husband—at least presumably<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
she found him an encumbrance—took to
literature as a minor novelist at Weimar. When
Arthur went to join her, he found that she
seemed to have forgotten the memory of his father;
and before very long they quarrelled. At
the age of twenty-one Arthur determined to enter
the university of Göttingen as a medical student;
and later on took to philosophy, and gained
his Ph.D. It was probably while he was at the
university that he caught syphilis; and for long
underwent the heroic doses of mercury at intervals
that the nineteenth century thought essential
for the cure of that disease. It was not till
the time of Fournier and Sir Jonathan Hutchinson
that it was recognised that, while mercury
was essential, it was not so much the amount of
mercury as the faithful years of its intermittent
duration that were really necessary; and Schopenhauer
duly went through the proper course of
huge doses accompanied by all the wretchedness
of salivation, depression, and internal pain,
that used to be thought necessary for every syphilitic
if he would escape the legendary tortures of
that wonderful disease. He frequently complained
to his friends of his treatment; but, in
spite of the sufferings that it caused him, he had
in reality little to complain about, for he lived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
to seventy years of age and escaped the graver
nervous troubles that often accompany untreated
syphilis. Nowadays, of course, we should put
him on injections of one of the arseno-benzol compounds,
accompanied probably with rubbings,
pills or injections of mercury, and insist on his
taking moderate exercise in the fresh air and living
a sober, righteous and godly life without excitement
or dissipation. While we should be
chary of giving a definite prognosis we should
tell him that probably he would see no more of
his disease either in himself or his children if he
took care of himself and faithfully continued his
treatment. But Schopenhauer, while escaping
the more serious nervous, bone and skin manifestation
of syphilis, evidently did not escape the
psychasthenic troubles, the obsessions and imperative
ideas—the phobias; and syphilophobia
had him in its grip till the end of his life. In this
strange condition the patient becomes possessed
by an undue terror of syphilis and its results; and
often the fear of syphilis becomes transferred to
the fear of every other infectious disease until
his life becomes a burden to him as he walks perpetually
in the presence of evil spirits which ache
to devour him. Probably it was to these phobias
that he owed his unnatural hatred of women, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
his hatred of the lower side of man’s nature. He
knew that these “under-sized, short-legged, long-haired
creatures who were not really beautiful,”
went about the world simply for the purpose of
spreading syphilis—made a trade of it, in short;
and that he, being a man of strongly sexual impulses,
could not resist their embrace, though he
knew it to be death. He had no wax wherewith
he might shut his ears to their siren songs, while
his sturdy rowers propelled his boat beside their
lair; he could not leave his house without knowing
that some of them would lure him with their
dreadful charms; how different the miserable
creatures were from the proper form of a human
being, which should be, like Arthur Schopenhauer
himself, a rather short, square, blue-eyed, sturdy
North German. And so his miserable life went
on, carrying its own torture with it, and daily his
thoughts turned more and more to the utter
wretchedness of life, and the stupidity of those
followers of Fichte and Hegel who simply <i>would</i>
not see the truth. Probably his pessimism was
a direct result of his syphilophobia.</p>

<p>He kept a diary in accordance with his plan of
absolute self-confession; and there are many
thoughts on love and marriage, written during the
years 1819-22 and 1825-31, which his modest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
English biographer describes as being quite too
frank for publication. These thoughts were written
down in English; probably Schopenhauer
doubted whether the Deity understood that language,
just as we nowadays are quite certain that
He does not understand French or Latin. But
we can leave them unread, in the certain surety
that they were completely coarse.</p>

<p>He now fell into a quarrel with Hegel, for, as
he thought, purposely setting the world against
the mighty Arthur Schopenhauer, of whom probably
Hegel at that time had never heard in his
life. He now began to indulge in that most expensive
and unsatisfactory of all amusements,
lawsuits.</p>

<p>In 1821 he found three women gossiping on
the landing outside his door; so naturally he
complained to his landlady, who assured him
that such a thing would not happen again. Alas!
a few days later there they were again, still cackling.
Schopenhauer warned them to be off, and
not to disturb his lordly self. Two of them, being
meek and as he thought women really should
be, departed, but the third was of sterner stuff and
refused. She was a maiden sempstress of fifty
who lived in the room higher up. Schopenhauer
incontinently took her by the waist and threw her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
downstairs<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> with a coarse description of her
character to boot; and after her flung her sewing
and the tools of her trade. Heard a body ever the
like? She took him to court, as no proper woman
should do, and the philosopher defended his own
case. An ungallant judge decided in his favour,
and naturally the aggrieved lady appealed. This
short-legged, long-haired female actually appealed
against the decision given in favour of
the Right, in favour of the great pessimist philosopher,
of the Neo-Buddhist who just then
wanted to get away to Italy for a holiday! And
will it be believed that an unjust, nay, an inhuman,
judge would not postpone the hearing of
the appeal, so that once more Schopenhauer
should be able to air his eloquence. In Schopenhauer’s
absence in the sunny south the case was
decided against him, and he was sentenced to pay
the long-haired, etc., creature damages. Three
years later the spinster renewed her assaults upon
him, having discovered that he had injured her
so severely that she was unable to earn her living;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
and this time the court ordered Schopenhauer
to pay her a pension of £9 a year for the rest of
her life. This was really getting beyond a joke,
and Schopenhauer appealed; but unsuccessfully.
Therefore he was faced with the prospect of paying
the damsel this pension until the Greek calends;
for it is well known that women are very
hard to kill, and when they are in receipt of a
pension they will live for ever out of sheer spite.
But unfortunately for her she died of cholera
some time afterwards; and Schopenhauer, receiving
notice that he was relieved of pensioning her,
showed his joy by scrawling upon the paper the
appropriate—and obscene—words: “Obit anus—abit
onus.” Thus it was proved that from
woman came all man’s woes; but few men have
the chance to revenge themselves on the sex by an
epigram. As a rule, woman gets her epigram in
first, owing to her agile tongue.</p>

<p>The last few years of his life were spent at
Frankfurt-am-Main, where his was the most perfect
instance of a quiet and philosophic life of
which I have any knowledge, except Spinoza’s.
The fires of his youth and middle age had died
down, and the ashes took a long while to become
stone-cold. At half-past seven every morning he
rose and took a bath, taking particular care to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
wash his eyes very thoroughly.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Then, having
ordered his housekeeper strictly to keep to her
kitchen, he made himself coffee, and settled down
to work for three or four hours; this being in his
opinion the utmost that the human brain could
stand at severe intellectual labour, in which he
was probably right. At noon she came and
timidly knocked at his door, whereupon he left
his books and began to play upon his flute. At 1
p.m. he went to the Englischer Hof for dinner;
and there he ate in silence with a gold coin displayed
ostentatiously beside his plate. After this
had gone on for some years he explained to a
friend that he had kept the coin as a wager to
himself that he should present it to the poor-box
if anybody should start a discussion about any
single subject under the sun but women, wine, and
horses. After dinner, with the faithful coin still
unused in his pocket, he went home, read light literature
for a couple of hours, and at four o’clock
went for a brisk walk into the suburbs. His
only companion was a poodle-dog, and “Schopenhauer
with his dog” has become a legend; the
local children used to call it “young Schopenhauer.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
After two hours of walking at his utmost
speed, summer or winter, he went to the
reading-room, and read <i>The Times</i>. This literature
predisposing him for sleep, he went home, ate
a very light supper, got out his long pipe, smoked
for an hour, “and so to bed.”</p>

<p>And this went on for about ten years, until, one
day he noticed that he could not walk quite so
fast as usual, and that he was beginning to get
breathless when he was going uphill. By this
time he had become more egotistical than ever;
his chief pleasure was in reading laudatory comments
in the newspapers upon Herr Doktor
Arthur Schopenhauer <i>hochwohlgeboren</i> and his
wonderful philosophy. Gradually praise and
public fame began to come to him. A steady
stream of people came to see him, among them
many women attracted by the thought of the
great woman-hater.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> As his heart began slowly
to fail his doctor visited him every day; until one
day the philosopher was laid up with a slight
attack of pneumonia. Recovering from this, he
tried to resume his invariable routine; but on September
20th he had another bad attack. On the
morning of the 21st he rose as usual. A few minutes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
after his housekeeper had left him, his doctor
called and found him lying dead on his sofa.
The Goddess Luetina, assuming her least terrible
appearance, had carried him to the Nirvana where
no women could trouble him.</p>

<p>It is one thing to write a witty essay against
women, just to annoy the feminists, who, poor
ladies, have such quaint ideas about men and are,
in physiological language so excessively ready to
react to stimuli. But Schopenhauer’s case was
far otherwise; with him it was a matter of coarseness
in his mind and sheer lust in his body. No
wonder he despised the animal in man. In hating
woman he was really hating himself because
he could not resist them.</p>

<p>And it was probably well for him that he had
to complain of his gigantic doses of mercury, for,
with his family history of a father who committed
suicide and his own worrying and neurotic mind,
he was just the sort of man to get cerebral syphilis
or general paralysis. I have read many attempts
to explain Schopenhauer’s misogyny, but I rather
fancy we can detect the real reason for it in his
own syphilophobia. Some critics have tried to
explain it by slandering his mother and sister, on
the assumption that every man can only judge
woman by the women he knows; and that Joanna<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
Schopenhauer and Adele Schopenhauer must
therefore have been of bad character. Possibly!
But he was full of phobias and obsessions. And
the best thing we read about him was his genuine
love for Beethoven. Often he would sit and listen
to a symphony, dreaming with his eyes shut;
and, the last divine chords sounded, he would
leave his seat rudely, lest some lesser music
should blur the impression.</p>

<p>I have often thought of writing a history of the
effect of syphilis upon the history of the world;
but the difficulties appal me. We now know that
syphilis is less a disease of skin and bone, than a
very grim disease of the nervous system; and so
secretive is it, so it loves to conceal itself under
other names, that even to-day, though every doctor
is acutely on the lookout for it, it would be
impossible from the mortality returns to pick out
which man or woman died of syphilis and which
of some apparently quite distinct affection. All
that is safe to say is that the very flower of the
human race, the greatest artists, poets, musicians
and philosophers, have all rested under a strong
suspicion of having fought against the spirochæte
before it killed them. Too likely such a history
as passes through my mind would degenerate into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
a mere <i>chronique scandaleuse</i>, and nobody would
believe it.</p>

<p>So long as there is this horrible and disgusting
prudery about syphilis, so long will it continue to
lay waste the fairest part of the human race; and
few doctors will disagree with Schopenhauer, the
poor hopeless syphilophobe, when he said that
war and syphilis are the two greatest foes to
humanity.</p>

<p>The great effect of the philosophy of Schopenhauer
has probably been indirect. When the
young undergraduate of Oxford enunciated the
belief that there is nothing new and nothing true,
and no matter, he probably thought that he was
quoting the beliefs of the great woman-hater; but
it was reserved for a mind far nobler and more
truly poetical to see the real inner meaning of
Schopenhauer’s thoughts. The great discovery of
Schopenhauer was that the evil in man has quite
as much to do with his character as the good.
Thomas Hardy, in writing the <i>Woodlanders</i> and
<i>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</i>, was really transfiguring
Schopenhauer’s somewhat arid philosophy until
it became a beautiful truth. Hardy, in a sense,
was simply a reaction from the foolish optimism
of the Victorians; from the cheerful caricaturing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
of human nature by Charles Dickens; from the
mock cynicism of Thackeray. That some people
still say that his novels are grey and unduly pessimistic
simply means that they have not yet
grasped the full truth about human nature. And
surely Hardy’s “Immanent Will” was truly
Schopenhaueresque.</p>

<p>Healthy minds have converted Schopenhauer’s
pessimism into the gentle pessimism of the present
day, which may be rather beautiful and poetical
than hideous. That Schopenhauer could be
so vulgarly insulting to women was simply the
index of his own diseased mind.</p>

<p>His opinions about women were merely an instance
of the utterly degrading effect of syphilis
upon the human brain and soul.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Baruch_Spinoza">Baruch Spinoza</h2>

</div>

<p>This, the most wonderful of all philosophers,
the most daring, the most scientific, was
born, a little Jew of Portuguese descent, in Amsterdam
on November 28th, 1632, at a time when
the European world was riven by the fiercest sectarian
contention; when the hounds of the Spanish
Inquisition were baying hell-fire and destruction
to any man who should dare to differ from
the dogmas of the pope as to objective truth. He
grew up to be a typical Oriental—like Jesus Himself—with
all the Oriental powers of mysticism.</p>

<p>Desirous of completing his knowledge of Latin,
he took lessons from a certain doctor of medicine,
one Van den Ende, who eked out his income by
taking pupils. Whether the worthy Van den
Ende employed his spare time by inoculating
Spinoza with what Hume afterwards called his
“hideous atheistical doctrines” is not apparently
known; but it seems certain that Spinoza thus
early came under the influence of that series of
ideas which so many people have complained of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
as “medical materialism,” whatever that may
mean. Ignorant people have, from the very earliest
times, complained that doctors have no religion;
that we only look upon the materialist
side of man; that we are blind to ethical truth
and to the eternal verities of Plato. This, of
course, is sheer nonsense. It is quite true that
few, if any, doctors have been burned at the stake
for a point of belief; but that is simply because
the medical profession has always preferred, if
burning were in the question, to be burned for
something that could be proved objectively, such
as the difference between scarlet fever and cancer,
for instance, and not because of an opinion that
apparently depends upon a state of mind or upon
the education that any given man has received,
or upon the surroundings in which he grew up.</p>

<p>It is said that Van den Ende had a daughter
with whom Spinoza fell in love; but the critics
have cast so many doubts upon the pretty romance
that has been woven between them that
nowadays it is not generally believed. Some rash
words of Spinoza’s having come to the ears of
the authorities of the synagogue, they summoned
him before them to explain; but, seeing that he
had already parted in very truth from the conventional
Hebrew worship, and not wishing to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
have any public scandal among the community,
the Chief Rabbi offered him a pension of 1,000
florins if he would outwardly conform and appear
occasionally in the synagogue; that is to say, if
Spinoza would turn hypocrite. But this was not
at all in accordance with Spinoza’s character, so,
since he refused to be coerced, it became necessary
to excommunicate him from the synagogue after
an unavailing attempt had been made by some
footpad to assassinate him. Spinoza drew up a
protest against his excommunication, but did not
publish it. He dropped the name of Baruch and
took the name of Benedict; in this possibly there
may have been a shimmer of irony at his excommunication,
for both names mean “blessed.”
Such irony would be in accordance with what one
might expect from a pupil of Van den Ende, who
in truth seems to have been an ironical man.
Later, he fell into trouble with the French authorities
in Paris, and was hanged for a conspirator.
Van den Ende seems to have been a very undoctor-like
sort of doctor, for it is seldom indeed
that any of our profession conspire with anybody;
least of all for a religious or political purpose.
Marat, of course, was a brilliant exception,
but he came to an untimely end.</p>

<p>Expelled from the Hebrew Church, and with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
the Inquisition waiting open-mouthed to burn him
if it had the chance, Spinoza spent the rest of his
short life in little towns of Holland, keeping himself
alive by grinding spectacles. The tubercle
bacillus was already beginning to eat away his
lungs, and men howled at him as an atheist
whenever he went into the street. But already
he had many admirers. A man named De Fries
left him a small fortune which Spinoza refused,
saying that the man’s brother and rightful heir
had more need of it than he. The brother accepted
it on the sole condition that Spinoza should
take sufficient money to keep him alive. Even of
this, which was offered on the assumption that
Spinoza would need 500 florins, he would only
accept 300 florins annually, and gave the rest to
the poor.</p>

<p>During the five years following his excommunication
Spinoza worked hard at his philosophical
speculations, and at his lens-grinding,
attaining a great reputation for thoroughness in
his work. A little society of doctors and medical
students was formed to study the Cartesian philosophy,
and by sheer learning, daring of speculation,
and elevation of moral character, the little
Hebrew became the leader; and thus began the
extraordinary admiration for the philosophy of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
Spinoza which has always distinguished biological
scientists.</p>

<p>Spinoza attained eminence in many ways before
the end came. His landlady, a Madame van
den Spyek, came to him in a religious difficulty.
She knew that Spinoza was good and learned,
though people <i>did</i> call him an atheist, and went
saying what a sorry time he would have of it when
the Inquisition got hold of him. Yet she heard
so much about the different sects, which were
struggling so fiercely all over Europe. What was
she, a decent and pious woman who worshipped
God after the manner of her fathers, to believe?
She would ask the gentle and learned atheist; so
she went diffidently to him and opened her heart
to him. Thus spake Spinoza: “Your religion is
a good religion, madame; you have no need to
seek after another, and neither need you doubt
of your eternal welfare so long as, with due pious
observances, you continue to live a life of peace
and charity with all.”</p>

<p>Just so might have spoken T. H. Huxley two
hundred years later; just so might have spoken
Plato two thousand years earlier; so assuredly
would not have spoken Bishop Tertullian, who
said, two hundred years after the crucifixion of a
loving and forgiving Jesus, “Credo quia impossibile,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
and rejoiced to think that those who differed
from him in opinions were safely frizzling
in hell.</p>

<p>Spinoza, in his strenuous devotion to scientific
truth, knowing nothing about the tiny rod-shaped
bacillus that was growing in his lungs, led a most
unhealthy life. Sometimes for three months together
his footsteps would not cross the lintel; he
lived a life of asceticism worthy of Nietzsche
himself, or of a monk of the Thebaid, though for
a very different reason. Eating just enough to
keep him alive and no more, cheerful and merry
with his friends, averse from all political and
religious contention, he was proud of only one
thing—his self-control. People said that he used
to be vastly amused by setting two spiders to fight
one another. Of course this story really represents
Spinoza’s interest in the weird marriage
rights of the Arachnidæ. These are really extraordinarily
interesting, and many a thoughtful
man has followed them, with the aid of an electric
torch, in the dusk of the evening when the sexes
conjoin. The female is considerably larger and
more powerful than the male; and she sits quietly
waiting with a naughty gleam in her bright eyes,
at the centre of the web. He, insignificant despicable
wretch, dances timidly towards her, two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
of his paws held out with the caution of a professional
pugilist. They meet, he continuing his
excessive caution. Then a moment of love, an
almost imperceptible caress, and he flees literally
for his life with hell at his heels. Should the dutiful
wife catch him, woe worth the day for the
husband. The wicked creature, having sated her
sinful lust, devours him, claw, spinnerets and all.
Marriage from the point of view of a spider must
be an exciting business. I do not know what are
the odds on the escape of the male; but doubtless
Spinoza worked them out from his own observations.
Personally I should fancy that the male
has about an even chance. I have often watched
among the mosquitoes only to find after an hour
that the male could not approach at all, dare he
never so wisely. But I have seen horrid orgies
of cannibalism should the husband be a shade too
slow. It is feminism <i>in excelsis</i>; she, great, big,
hulking brute that she is, cannibalistically eats
her dear little mate with his slender and spiderly
grace. And likes to do it, too. Fabre thought
that it was a sort of religious rite among the
Arachnidæ; but let us think better of the race of
spiders than that. I have no doubt whatever that
it was while Spinoza was watching the spiders at
their cannibalistic love-making that the amazing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
spectacle of the presence of so much cruelty in
Nature thrust itself before his mind, and led him
to speculate why he, too, a man so good and virtuous,
who had never harmed a single living creature
in his life, should yet be so ill and coughing
and sweating and spitting and falling away to a
shadow. It was then probably that he evolved
his stately system of pantheism that has so impressed
the scientific world. Why should the performance
of a purely natural function, one which
God has implanted in the spiders that they might
propagate their species, be attended with such
savagery? This story about Spinoza is told by
Dr. Colerus, the Lutheran divine who afterwards
became his biographer. Naturally Colerus misunderstood
Spinoza’s scientific enthusiasm, and
equally naturally Spinoza, being accused of atheism,
was also accused of cruelty as monstrous as
that of Domitian in his most palmy days. An
atheist in the seventeenth century was known to
be capable of all.</p>

<p>There is really little more to tell about the
short life of Spinoza. He was offered a post at
the University of Heidelberg as professor of
philosophy, but politely declined on the score of
his health. Probably he did so really because he
did not care to set himself in a position where a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
turn of the wheel of war might put him at the
mercy of the hounds of the Inquisition, with their
burnings and tortures and <i>auto da fe’s</i> and religious
wars. The real call to join his spirit with
that of the Immanent God came when he was
forty-two years old in 1674. However deeply a
man may speculate upon “God, Man, and his
well-being”—to name only one of his works—the
tubercle bacillus takes no heed of motives,
and will ever be ready to attack him if he denies
himself food and fresh air. Thus it was that his
friends of The Hague went quietly to church one
afternoon, doubtless thinking nothing of the
troublesome cough from which he had suffered
for so long; and that when they returned they did
not hear his cheerful voice, for he was lying dead
at his spectacle grinding.</p>

<p>He had a short life; we can sum it up in a few
words: Spinoza was a good man and he died
poor. When they came to look into his effects
they found nothing but a very little money, just
enough to satisfy his creditors; the tools of his
trade and a few lenses, which were afterwards
sold as being of great intrinsic value because he
had ground them so well.</p>

<p>It was many years before the real worth of the
little Hebrew began to dawn upon the world;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
and then it was not the doctors nor the scientific
men to whom it appealed but the poets, for like
all true poets he was a mystic. During the eighteenth
century, until the French Revolution began
to free men’s minds, he was looked upon as
an atheist, and even the good-natured Hume, possibly
ironically, spoke of his hideous atheistical
doctrine. But the poets, in the ecstasy of joy that
accompanied the liberation of mankind, saw far
otherwise. Goethe begun to understand him, and
Novalis, the German hymn-writer, spoke famously
of him as a “God-intoxicated man”; a
man drunk with the intellectual love of God.
Indeed, the very word “love” is too carnal a term
to apply to Spinoza’s philosophy. It was probably
some such feeling that led people to hesitate
deeply before changing the ancient terms “Faith,
Hope, and Charity” into “Faith, Hope, and
Love,” although Spinoza in his mysticism, and
our modern mystic, Professor Freud,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> would have
approved it.</p>

<p>After Novalis came Coleridge and Wordsworth;
and thenceforward Spinoza’s fame began
rapidly to extend, until it has influenced the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
whole of modern thought. Benjamin Jowett, in
one of his biological sermons delivered in Edinburgh,
the home of Calvinism, spoke of him as
one of the best men who ever lived, and compared
his life to that of John Bunyan, sorrowfully
admitting that the tinker would probably
have burnt the spectacle-grinder if they could
have met.</p>

<p>Like Jowett, Dean Inge also has been touched
by the wonder of Baruch the Jew. “Beatitudo
non est premium virtutis, sed ipsa virtus,” said
Spinoza. “Heaven,” repeats Dean Inge, “is not
the <i>reward</i> of virtue; it is virtue itself.” And
again speaking of Spinoza, he says, “No thoroughgoing
rationalist philosophy can explain the
working of a mind in love.”</p>

<p>Accepting as proved that Spinoza’s philosophy
has enormously influenced the modern world, let
us consider what it really is. Spinoza’s pantheism
does not consist, as so many amiable spiritualists
seem to think, of a kindly God of mystic
light, surrounded by a fluttering crowd of disembodied
spirits with a general atmosphere of
worship throughout the universe. It is a highly
mystical and rather stern philosophy which leads
to surprising results and best explains the known
facts of life. God is infinite, with attributes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
extension and thought; therefore He must embrace
all good and all evil. As He is infinite He
must be coterminous with the universe in which
there can be nothing else but God. In fact, God
is reality. God is the universe. Christ, in Spinoza’s
view, is a mystical conception Who includes
all the gentleness, all the wisdom, all the loving-kindness,
of the world. He is the method by
which God communicated His will to man. Putting
it briefly, Spinoza was a complete monist,
who made no distinction whatever between spirit
and matter.</p>

<p>The further we extend scientific inquiry the
more we confirm Spinoza’s views of the universe.
Nebulæ have been discovered whose light takes
a million years to reach the earth; so also did
Spinoza account for the existence of evil in the
world, that it could only exist because God allowed
it, and as we cannot understand why God
should allow it, the natural corollary must be
that it is a part of Himself. As his fellow-Jew
Heine said: “All our modern philosophers, perhaps
unconsciously to themselves, see through the
glasses that Baruch Spinoza ground.”</p>

<p>Spinoza began the revolt against the orthodox
conception of a fall from virtue on the part of
man; and he was strongly supported by the doctrine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
of evolution which was the greatest contribution
of the nineteenth century to thought.
One would have thought that there could be no
single educated man in the world to-day who does
not firmly believe that man has ascended from
an ape-like animal, for one has only to stroll
around any decent museum to see the irrefragable
proofs in the skulls and prehistoric remains of
man who lived far beyond recorded time, long
before man had learned to speak or to act with
his fellow-man in societies. Yet to this day some
obscurantists try to prohibit the teaching of
natural selection; as if it mattered! In spite
of them natural selection will go on triumphant,
however the wilfully blind may rage. But we
have passed beyond the stage of natural selection
so far as man is concerned. We now live in the
age of intellect, the psychozoic age. The little
naked, helpless creature that had so stern a fight
for existence against the mammoth and the
woolly rhinoceros has developed a brain such as
never was in the world before, and that brain is
beginning to take a hand in nature’s game. Evolution
is proceeding, not by tooth and claw, not
by ravening and bloodshed, but by the discoveries
of such men as Luther Burbank, who has revolutionised
horticulture; of Henry Ford, who has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
revolutionised transport; and of our own Australian
Farrar, who, by revolutionising wheat-growing,
has made it possible for two blades of wheat
to grow where one grew before. In the world of
ideas evolution is proceeding by the thoughts of
such men as Darwin, Nietzsche, Schopenhauer
and thousands of young biologists. The brain
of man will work towards perfection possibly by
birth control, sterilisation of the unfit, and beyond
all by the elimination of syphilis.</p>

<p>The process of evolution towards righteousness
was interrupted for five sad years by the World
War, which was due to a stupid misunderstanding
of that very doctrine of evolution to which
Spinoza’s philosophy had pointed the way. But
pantheism must be looked upon, not as a religion,
but as a scientific philosophy. As a religion it
does not satisfy the heart of man.</p>

<p>Eternity, according to Spinoza, is not merely
a long time: it is really a mode of thought, and
cannot be reduced to measurements of time.
That is strangely like what one hears from countless
pulpits to-day, if the occupants thereof have
opened their ears to modern thought. We are
living in eternity to-day, and should act as if our
actions were to be eternal. Still speaking mystically,
heaven is to be a good man; hell is to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
a bad man. There can be nothing worse even if
we do know what is happening to us after death.
And no better man ever lived upon the earth than
the despised little Jew, Spinoza. Except for fear
of being accused of perpetrating an epigram upon
a most solemn subject, I might say that it is better
to be God-intoxicated with Spinoza than
priest-intoxicated with the various unphysiological
Christian creeds. T. H. Huxley, who was
accused of all sorts of nonsense, recognised that
it was necessary to create an ideal Jesus for man,
because, as the critics have shown, owing to the
intervention of very imperfect men, we do not
really know what were His real teachings; still,
we must make an ideal for ourselves; and for
every man his own religion must lie between himself
and his God, or it is no religion. But so long
as it leads to tolerance, mercy, loving-kindness,
and duty, he cannot go far wrong. All these
things were taught by Spinoza, and, so far as we
know, by Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>But possibly the recent discovery of the unconscious
mind may have cast a doubt even upon the
stately pantheism of Spinoza. Possibly what he
took to be the attributes of God are in reality
purely human conceptions. Possibly animals,
being so much more under the influence of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
unconscious mind than men are, do not feel as we
do, and there may not be so much cruelty in the
world as we suppose. We know that in men the
unconscious mind was the first to be evolved, and
certainly it is the last to die.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> To that extent at
least may we give thanks to God, and as George
Santayana says in his essay on Spinoza to all the
little men who have sneered at Spinoza: “I do
not believe you; God is great.”</p>

<p>But if Spinoza was the greatest of philosophers
we must also remember that he was one
of the first, if not the very first, of the critics
of the Bible who endeavoured to see that wonderful
book through clear glasses, through spectacles
that were properly ground, because he had
ground them himself. He had not the advantage
of modern physiology and psychology,
whereby we know that a book, written by men
in a state of semi-savagery, such as Moses and
the other supposed authors of the Pentateuch,
must reflect their semi-savage minds and the
thickened cerebral arteries which must have been
theirs if they were so old as tradition states.
None the less he came to very much the same
conclusions as have been reached by the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
learned and scientific of modern commentators.
As the doctrine of evolution has cast a doubt
amounting to certainty upon the story of creation,
so Spinoza, by reason of his intellectual
love of God, has cast a doubt upon the theory
of a personal God, of an all-wise and all-loving
Father. The existence of evil in the world, so
ever-present, so clamant, so insistent, by itself
disproves the existence of such a personality.
Where was the fatherly God of the deists when
the late war broke out? Perchance he slept or
was gone on a journey. Such an absentee God
is no God for modern man. By recognising
that evil, if, and so far as it exists, must be
part of God himself, Spinoza fell in absolutely
with modern thought, only he lived three hundred
years too soon. But the discovery, or
hypothesis, of the unconscious mind, has had
still more startling effects upon philosophy; for
who can now say that he is not unconsciously
listening to the voice of his grandmother when
he is formulating his most earnest conclusions?
Those sanguine persons, mostly politicians who
state proudly that they are satisfied to remain
undisturbed with the beliefs that they have
learned at their mother’s knee, are probably unconsciously
retailing the beliefs that she in her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
turn learned from her mother, and she from
hers. Beliefs acquired in very early youth remain
till the end of life as if they were divine;
Gibbon has shown the debt that the early Church
owed to women, who were doubtless the contemporary
mothers and grandmothers and had the
maternal mind; dear, amiable, credulous, superstitious
creatures they were, though perhaps a
trifle narrow-minded. Undoubtedly these women
were not persons of critical and scientific mind,
though to every one of their sons and grandsons
they must have seemed to speak with awful
“respectability,” just as old ladies do to this
very day. It has been very well said that whenever
one feels a conviction of absolute certainty
approximating to the divine, one is probably
listening to the still small voice of the “herd”
speaking through one’s unconscious memory; and
common experience is that the herd generally
speaks most emphatically through the dulcet
tones of that dear old lady, that real transmitter
of the herd ideas of past generations, the grandmother.
<i>She</i>, not Spinoza, nor Nietzsche, nor
Darwin, nor Schopenhauer, has been the real
maker of thought to the present day.</p>

<p>Let Spinoza and Nietzsche go hang as abominations
unto the Lord, atheists and capable of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
the utmost wickedness—but <i>not</i> of sectarian
wars and wholesale tortures and burnings. And
as for Voltaire—one simply shudders at his
ribaldry and irrepressible mockery of so-called
religion which caused savage persecution in the
name of the best and most merciful of men—Jesus
Christ. To that extent at least <i>l’infame</i>
has passed away, largely owing to Voltaire,
though personally he could not have been a very
nice man if all tales are true. But certain sects
are still willing to apply another form of torture
than thumbscrew, rack and stake to those who
dare to differ in opinion from their grandmothers.</p>

<p>I see that I have omitted the most mystical
of Spinoza’s conceptions. God, besides having
the attributes mentioned, has infinite substance.
That was really why they turned him out of the
synagogue, and would have liked to burn him
if they could. The idea of giving a body to
God whom St. John defined as an emotion!
God is <i>Love</i>! Nowadays the identification of
matter with electricity and the modern conception
of the ether is the nearest that science can
reach to Spinoza’s dreamings, but that in no way
detracts from his extraordinary insight into the
universe. Even taking Spinozism in its most
material aspect, we find that the more we extend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
the bounds of the known universe the greater it
becomes, until infinity seems to become rather
more than a mere mathematical conception denoted
by a mathematical symbol.</p>

<p>What we gain from Spinoza then—and the
best of men, the best of the clergy, agree—is
that eternity is a state of mind; that is to say,
it is a purely human conception. Perhaps if we
go further and say that good and evil, instead
of being attributes of the infinite God, are also
purely human conceptions, we shall come still
nearer to absolute truth.</p>

<p>But quite clearly the notion of God as an all-wise
and all-loving Father is inconsistent with
medical experience. The only decent thing nature
has done for man is to give us our unconscious
minds, without which we should be
stunned and maddened by the intolerable thunder
of our hearts, the rushing through our
arteries, the incessant dripping of our kidneys
and even more uncomely internal parts. And
the way nature has treated woman is still more
shocking. Any earthly father who treated his
children as nature has treated woman would be
considered rather as a stepfather.</p>

<p>Nowadays Spinoza’s pantheism suggests to
scientific men the mighty forces that lie locked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
up within the atom.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> So far as we know, the
universe, however vast it may be, is, in the last
resource, composed of atoms. But once again,
and fifty times over, I would most strenuously
say that pantheism is a philosophy: it is <i>not</i> a
religion. It is too stern, too scientific, too consistent
with known facts, ever to attract the
countless bruised hearts, relics of the late war,
longing for comfort in their grief.</p>

<p>Even otherwise intelligent men often ask me
whether the <i>Religio Medici</i> of Sir Thomas
Browne really represents the religion of modern
doctors. The nearest approach to a talk about
religion I have ever heard from a doctor was
once when I heard one doctor say of another
that he was believed to pray for his patients;
but in that I seem to scent a savour of professional
jealousy. Otherwise I might almost feel
justified in saying that <i>Religio Medici</i> is generally
considered by doctors to be a farrago of
quackery, mysticism, credulity, and astrology,
put into gorgeous and quite unnecessarily obscure
language; full of sound and fury; signifying
nothing. Probably Browne was unconsciously
remembering the teachings of some old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
lady who had impressed the truth upon him in
his early infancy—probably with her slipper.</p>

<p>But I cannot close this essay upon the greatest
of all philosophers better than by repeating the
words of Ernest Renan upon him when they
dedicated the great statue at The Hague in
1882: “Woe unto him who in passing should
hurl an insult at this gentle and pensive head.
He would be punished, as all vulgar souls are
punished, by his own vulgarity, and by his incapacity
to conceive what is divine. This man
from his granite pedestal will point out to all
men the way of blessedness which he had found;
and ages hence the cultivated traveller, passing
by this spot, will say in his heart, ‘The truest
vision man ever had of God, came perhaps,
here.’”</p>

<p>Nor can one do better than follow Spinoza so
far as earthly intelligence can lead us. Those
people whose hearts the war has left bruised and
broken are fortunate if they can still believe
what they learned at their mother’s knee. She,
dear, simple, lovable soul, knew nothing about
the unconscious mind, nor physiology, nor historical
criticism, nor Spinoza and his majestic
pantheism. All she knew was that her sons were
unhappy, and she must comfort them as best she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
could. Men have always been unhappy, and
women have always tried to comfort them according
to their sons’ needs. All good men have
the same religion, and they have all learned it
at their mother’s knee.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Of all the philosophers who have tried to solve
the awful mystery of the Infinite God, Baruch
Spinoza probably came as near to it as He will
ever allow.</p>

<p>But man must work out his own salvation, and
it is not right to blame the infinite God if anything
fails to happen as we desire. “Let us still
cultivate our garden.”</p>

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
